<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Aerodynamics: Selected Topics in the Light of Their Historical Development (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering)</h2><p><p>Authoritative and engaging, this popular history traces the science of aerodynamics from the age of Newton through the mid-twentieth century. Author Theodore von Karman, a well-known pioneer in aerodynamic research, addresses himself to readers acquainted with the facts of aviation but less familiar with the field's underlying theories.<br>A former director of the Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, von Karman founded the U.S. Institute of Aeronautical Sciences in 1933. In this volume, he employs straightforward, nontechnical language to recount the behind-the-scenes struggles of engineers and physicists with problems associated with lift, drag, stability, aeroelasticity, and the sound barrier. He explains how an increasing understanding of the motion of air and its forces on moving objects enabled significant improvements in airplane design, performance, and safety.<br>Other topics include the effects of speed on ailerons; the factors behind the phenomenon of a sonic boom; and the plethora of problems surrounding the inception of space travel: surmounting the earth's gravitational field, negotiating a safe return, and sustaining life amid the perils of interstellar radiation, weightlessness, and meteoric activity.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Communicating with Intelligence: Writing and Briefing for National Security (Security and Professional Intelligence Education Series)</h2><p>Communicating with Intelligence was the first book to teach the skills needed to make sure that papers, reports, and other products be correctly written by intelligence students and professionals. It also responded to the increased number of degrees in intelligence and national security offered in academic institutions. <br><br>Aimed at students, faculty, and practitioners, the book is designed to provide all necessary information on how to prepare, write, and read intelligence publications:<br><br><ul><li>Foundations of successful intelligence communication</li><li>Differences between academic and intelligence writing </li><li>How to use arguments </li><li>Framework for analysis</li><li>Writing toolkit</li><li>How the briefing process works</li><li>Guide to creating citations</li><li>How to handle classified materials</li><li>Samples of individual and group exercises</li></ul><br>This fully revised and expanded edition will be an essential tool for anyone who needs to learn or hone their skills in how to communicate with intelligence effectively.</p><p>James S. Major spent 40 years in intelligence, serving in both military and civilian capacity, in assignments at the tactical, operational, strategic, and national levels. He has written 15 books, all published by the U.S. government, and in 1997 he was awarded the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement.<br>Communication is the essence of intelligence. For without being communicated effectively, intelligence merely underwrites ignorance. This fully revised and expanded edition of the noteworthy volume Communicating with Intelligence provides intelligence practitioners with a comprehensive and detailed handbook for effective professional communications. Its chapters set out practical guidelines along with practical exercises for each element of the communications process, from the reading of intelligence source material, to the writing of intelligence reports, to the delivery of intelligence briefings, emphasizing throughout the trustworthy dissemination of intelligence information. This is indeed an encyclopedic manual that should be on the desk of intelligence analysts, managers, and policy-makers. It would also be a valuable asset for academic writers and graduate students in the Intelligence Studies domain. (Martin Rudner, Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus, Carleton University, Canada)<br><br>James Major's new edition of Communicating with Intelligence is full of pragmatic advice that will resonate with both beginner and advanced intelligence students. Major covers every imaginable aspect of writing and briefing for intelligence analysts in conversational (and accessible) detail. Most importantly, he does in one book what other writers have done in several: the book covers grammar, writing, presentation skills, and career advice. For intelligence analysis students and practitioners, Major's book is a must-read. (Melissa Graves, Associate Director and Instructor, Center for Intelligence and Security Studies, The University of Mississippi; Co-Author of Introduction to Intelligence Studies (2012))<br><br>In the past, senior U.S. military commanders have complained that the intelligence reports and briefings they received were &#x2018;mush&#x2019; and provided little value to their decision-making. However, writing and briefing intelligence are not easy tasks. In this new edition, James Major greatly simplifies these tasks by delving into the mechanics of transforming raw intelligence into final products that deliver to intelligence consumers the information they need. Through easy-to-understand explanations, numerous examples and practical exercises, and even a healthy infusion of humor, the author teaches the reader how to communicate effectively. This book will be an invaluable addition to the bookshelves of all intelligence professionals, whether newly-minted or veteran. (Christopher A. Vallandingham, USAR, Associate University Librarian/Adjunct Law Professor, University of Florida Levin College of Law)<br><br>Aimed at students, faculty, and practitioners, the book is designed to provide all necessary information on how to prepare, write, and read intelligence publications. Divided in four parts, it first outlines the foundations of good intelligence communication, with topics such as the difference between academic and intelligence writing, using arguments, and framework for analysis. It then provides a toolkit to write from the first draft to analytical papers before discussing the briefing process and concluding with how to handle citations and classified materials. Each chapter contains exercises, which can be done individually or as a group activity.</p><h2>Evidence-Based Technical Analysis: Applying the Scientific Method and Statistical Inference to Trading Signals</h2><p><i>Evidence-Based Technical Analysis</i> examines how you can apply the scientific method, and recently developed statistical tests, to determine the true effectiveness of technical trading signals. Throughout the book, expert David Aronson provides you with comprehensive coverage of this new methodology, which is specifically designed for evaluating the performance of rules/signals that are discovered by data mining.</p><p><p>"Professor Aronson has done yeoman's work incorporating established statistical practices into the analysis and interpretation of technical analysis and other market theories.

In order for technical analysis to deliver useful knowledge that can be applied to trading, it must evolve into a rigorous observational science. </p><p>Over the past two decades, numerous articles in respected academic journals have approached technical analysis in a scientifically rigorous and intellectually honest manner, and now, <i>Evidence-Based Technical Analysis</i> looks to continue down this path.

A critical facet of any mid- to large-sized company, this &#x201c;super-discipline&#x201d; has expanded to cover the management and output of information across the entire organization; from email, social media, and cloud computing to electronic records and documents, the IG umbrella now covers nearly every aspect of your business. As more and more everyday business is conducted electronically, the need for robust internal management and compliance grows accordingly. This book offers big-picture guidance on effective IG, with particular emphasis on document and records management best practices.</p> <p>Step-by-step strategy development guidance is backed by expert insight and crucial advice from a leading authority in the field. This new second edition has been updated to align with the latest practices and regulations, providing an up-to-date understanding of critical IG concepts and practices.</p> <ul> <li>Explore the many controls and strategies under the IG umbrella</li> <li>Understand why a dedicated IG function is needed in today&#x2019;s organizations</li> <li>Adopt accepted best practices that manage risk in the use of electronic documents and data</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Learn how IG and IT technologies are used to control, monitor, and enforce information access and security policy</li> </ul> <p>IG strategy must cover legal demands and external regulatory requirements as well as internal governance objectives; integrating such a broad spectrum of demands into workable policy requires a deep understanding of key concepts and technologies, as well as a clear familiarity with the most current iterations of various requirements. <i>Information Governance</i> distills the best of IG into a primer for effective action.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p><p><p>There has been a "perfect storm" of sorts that fueled concerns for information privacy, data protection, and regulatory compliance. The 2018 EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), amidst the drumbeat of colossal data breaches and major privacy violations, ignited a wave of increased activity in the field of information governance (IG). In today's environment, it is vital that business managers have a clear understanding of the methods and best practices used to control and secure information, and the opportunities to leverage information asset value. That requires an effective IG program. </p><p>The revised and updated <i>Second Edition</i> of <i>Information Governance</i> offers an important guide that reviews the basic concepts of IG, defines what it is (and what it is not), explains how to justify and implement an IG program, and explores ways to secure and control information while maximizing its value using infonomics principles. </p><p>The discipline of IG covers a range of components: privacy, cybersecurity, e-discovery and law, records management, compliance, information technology, risk management, business operations, and more. Filled with illustrative examples and written in clear language, <i>Information Governance</i> addresses the many aspects of IG with actionable strategies and proven best practices. </p><p>Written by a noted expert in the field with contributions from a number of industry pioneers and experts, <i>Information Governance</i> explains how to plan and manage a cohesive and effective IG program. The contributors offer guidance and insights for managing IG programs from a variety of perspectives. The risks inherent in managing information are considered, and the book explores how to apply IG to a number of platforms including email, social media, mobile devices, and cloud computing, as well as governing newer technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain. </p><p>The author offers insight for implementing and maintaining an effective IG program and includes recommendations for fostering a culture of compliance. In addition, the book contains important information on major regulations related to privacy, data protection, and records management. It also shows how to break down traditional information silos using a cross-functional approach, and what IG looks like in the Legal, IT, Privacy and Security, and Records Management functions which support business operations.</p><p><b>Proven and emerging strategies for implementing information governance programs using best practices</b> </p><p><i>"Effective Information Governance</i><b><i></i></b> <i>(IG) programs improve operational efficiency and compliance capabilities while leveraging information as an asset to maximize its value.

Republicans nominated for president a wealthy businessman and former reality show host best known on the campaign trail for his sharp rhetoric against immigration and foreign trade. Democrats nearly selected a self-described socialist who ran on a populist platform against the influence of big money in politics. <br><br>While it is not surprising that Americans would channel their frustrations into votes for contenders who pledge to end business as usual, the truth is that we don&#x2019;t have to pin our hopes for greater participation on any one candidate. All of us have a say&#x2014;if we learn, master and practice the skills of effective citizenship. <br><br>One of the biggest roadblocks to participation in democracy is the perception that privileged citizens and special interests command the levers of power and that everyday Americans can&#x2019;t fight City Hall. That perception is undoubtedly why a 2015 Pew Charitable Trusts survey found that 74 percent of those Americans surveyed believed that most elected officials didn't care what people like them thought. <br><br>Graham and Hand intend to change that conventional wisdom by showing citizens how to flex their citizenship muscles. They describe effective citizenship skills and provide tips from civic experts. Even more importantly, they offer numerous examples of everyday Americans who have used their skills to make democracy respond. The reader will see themselves in these examples of citizens who chose to be victorious participants rather than tranquil spectators in the arena of democracy. By the end of the book, you will have new confidence that citizen participation is the lifeblood of America -- and will be ready to make governments work for you, not the other way around.</p><p>"America, the Owner's Manual is a timely, hands-on guide demonstrating how citizens can bring about real change in their communities. Senator Bob Graham and co-author Chris Hand first show how to identify a problem, and then walk through each step of the process&#x2014;from researching the issue, to getting others involved, to engaging the media. Each chapter starts with a real case that demonstrates a step in the process, and ends with a summary checklist that helps readers put their plan into action. &#x201c;Tips from the Pros&#x201d; throughout bring additional applied perspectives on how to be most effective. By offering concrete guidance, an array of resources, and advice for troubleshooting and overcoming barriers, this compact user&#x2019;s guide is truly a handbook for change. <br> <br>Forty years ago, as a member of the Florida Legislature, Bob Graham took on the challenge of civic education for eighteen weeks at a Miami-area high school. His time as both a governor and a senator has only strengthened his resolve to pique readers&#x2019; curiosity about politics and teach them to get what they want from government."<p>Following 12 years of service in the Florida Legislature,&nbsp;<strong>Bob Graham</strong> was elected governor of Florida in 1978. During&nbsp;two successful terms as governor, Graham was nationally recognized&nbsp;for reforms in education, environmental protection,&nbsp;and economic diversification. Upon concluding his two terms&nbsp;as governor, Graham had an 83 percent approval rating from&nbsp;the people of Florida.&nbsp;<br><br>Graham was elected to the United States Senate in 1986,&nbsp;serving three consecutive terms. As a member of the Senate Finance, Environment&nbsp;and Public Works, and Veterans Affairs Committees, he was a leader on health, trade,&nbsp;tax, water and infrastructure issues.&nbsp;<br><br>One of Graham&#x2019;s most important contributions came during his last Senate&nbsp;term, when he was named chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence. As&nbsp;Senator he cosponsored the bill to create the Director of National Intelligence position&nbsp;and co-chaired the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before&nbsp;and After the Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001. In 2016, Graham received&nbsp;international attention for urging President Obama to declassify and make public 28&nbsp;pages redacted from the final Joint Inquiry report. Graham also authored the 2004&nbsp;book <em>Intelligence Matters</em> and the 2011 novel <em>Keys to the Kingdom</em>, both revealing&nbsp;serious faults in the U.S. national security system.&nbsp;<br><br>Graham may be best known for his workdays. During the nearly 30 years that he&nbsp;campaigned for or served as Florida&#x2019;s Governor and U.S. Senator, Graham worked at&nbsp;more than 400 jobs alongside Floridians. His first workday was teaching citizenship&nbsp;at Carol City High School in Miami Gardens, Florida. Graham wrote of these experiences&nbsp;in his first book <em>Workdays: Finding Florida on the Job</em>.&nbsp;<br><br>Since leaving the Senate in early 2005, Graham has led national commissions on&nbsp;weapons of mass destruction, the BP oil spill, and financing public higher educations.&nbsp;He spent the 2005&#x2013;2006 academic year at Harvard University&#x2019;s Kennedy School of&nbsp;Government as a senior fellow. Graham continues his work in environmental protection&nbsp;as chair of the Florida Conservation Coalition.

In 2008, Hand served as one of 27 Florida&nbsp;electors in the United States Electoral College.&nbsp;In 2010, Graham and Hand authored the original version<br>of this book, entitled <em>America, the Owner&#x2019;s Manual: Making&nbsp;Government Work for You</em>.<br><br>From 2011 to 2015, Hand served as Chief of Staff at the consolidated City of&nbsp;Jacksonville, Florida&#x2015;the largest city by area in the contiguous United States and the&nbsp;12th largest by population in the entire nation&#x2015;during the administration of Mayor&nbsp;Alvin Brown. As Chief of Staff, Hand managed the Mayor&#x2019;s Office team, with oversight&nbsp;for policy, advocacy, communications, outreach and scheduling. He also led&nbsp;the advancement of strategic initiatives, including efforts to achieve comprehensive&nbsp;pension reform for taxpayers and public safety employees. Those efforts culminated&nbsp;in the enactment of a landmark agreement in 2015.<br><br>Hand graduated with honors from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and&nbsp;International Affairs at Princeton University and the Fredric G. Levin College of&nbsp;Law at the University of Florida. At Princeton, Chris was honored with the <em>Daily&nbsp;Princetonian</em> Award for his successful efforts to reform the university&#x2019;s then centuryold&nbsp;Honor Code.

He argues that these areas should no longer be considered separate processes, handled by technical specialists with limited spheres of expertise. People, risk and security management should be treated as a critically important integrated business management system.&nbsp;</p><p>People may be your greatest asset &#x2013; but they can also be your biggest liability.</p><p>They expose you to all sorts of risks &#x2013; risks from things they can do (or fail to do) and from things that can be done to them. No matter how tight a risk and security management policy may be in theory, it can fail on its first contact with reality if it doesn&#x2019;t understand the people involved.</p><p>Wright understands people, risk and security like few others. For years he was in charge people management for leading oil companies &#x2013; getting people into and out of some of the most dangerous and hostile work environments on the planet &#x2013; and keeping them safe while they were there. Then he was responsible for a private army, literally licenced to kill, guarding nuclear submarines that were being decommissioned as part of the Megatons to Megawatts program.</p><p> </p><p>Risk is more than a set of formulas. Security is more than guns, gates, and badges. Both ultimately come down to the people you are responsible for. One day, the depth of your understanding of that connection may what stands between you and disaster. &nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Lance Wright is a Washington DC based management consultant and former international energy executive with a broad global business experience at the highest executive levels.

It outlines the relationship between JCL and the IBM mainframe, provides instruction for coding JCL, introduces special features, details the management of VSAM files, and describes the use of system tools. Menendez is a programmer/ systems analyst with some 12 years of experince working on IBM mainframes; Lowe is a technical author whose earlier book on MVS JCL is the forerunner of this one. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Since the first edition of our JCL book came out in 1980, more than 165,000 programmers have learned JCL from it. Now, we think the improvements to this latest edition, both in the content itself and in the way it&#x2019;s organized into paired pages, are going to make training and reference easier than ever before.We know how frustrating JCL can be. You write a program that requires some feature of JCL you haven&#x2019;t used before. So you have to dig through the IBM manuals, trying to figure out which of the details apply to your situation. Or you have to copy a co-worker&#x2019;s JCL without understanding it, crossing your fingers that the job will run. Or you have to consult the resident JCL &#x201c;guru&#x201d; in your shop, who tells you one secret at a time. Once you finally figure out a way to handle the JCL, you do it the same way forever...no matter if it&#x2019;s the best way or if you know how it works. <p>But Murach&#x2019;s OS/390 and z/OS JCL ends the frustration and lets you reach a new level of professionalism in a minimum of time. It takes a practical approach to JCL that zeroes in on everyday jobs, so you can learn to code significant job streams in a hurry. It&#x2019;s filled with syntax and examples, so you have plenty of guides for coding JCL on your own. And all the content is presented in our distinctive paired-pages method that saves you so much training and reference time, you&#x2019;ll wonder how you ever got along without it.</p></p><h2>Evolutionary Writings: Including the Autobiographies (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This unique anthology brings together a marvelous collection of Darwin's most accessible and significant writings, providing the most fully rounded picture of his ideas to be found in a single volume.

Boaventura de Sousa Santos shows why global social justice is not possible without global cognitive justice. Santos argues that Western domination has profoundly marginalised knowledge and wisdom that had been in existence in the global South. She contends that today it is imperative to recover and valorize the epistemological diversity of the world. Epistemologies of the South outlines a new kind of bottom-up cosmopolitanism, in which conviviality, solidarity and life triumph against the logic of market-ridden greed and individualism.</p><p><b>Boaventura de Sousa Santos</b> is Professor of Sociology at the University of Coimbra (Portugal) and Distinguished Legal Scholar at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.

At the same time, the book is carefully researched, thoroughly argued, critically alert, erudite, original, and challenging. It contains detailed inter-connected arguments. . .that defy brief summary, defending a variety of provocative claims that deal with political, economic, social, social scientific, and historical, as well as scientific matters. . .Nevertheless, whether or not the conclusions of Epistemologies of the South are endorsed, I hope that it contributes to making central in the agenda of the philosophy of science questions about the role that science might play in fostering &#x2015; or undermining &#x2015; cognitive and social justice, and under what interpretation it should do so." <br>&#x2015;Metascience <br> <br>"A blockbuster work, disconcerting and judicious.

Paul Getty Museum, found itself confronted by a century-old genocide. The Armenian Church was suing for the return of eight pages from the Zeytun Gospels, a manuscript illuminated by the greatest medieval Armenian artist, Toros Roslin. Protected for centuries in a remote church, the holy manuscript had followed the waves of displaced people exterminated during the Armenian genocide. Passed from hand to hand, caught in the confusion and brutality of the First World War, it was cleaved in two. Decades later, the manuscript found its way to the Republic of Armenia, while its missing eight pages came to the Getty.</p> <p><i>The Missing Pages</i> is the biography of a manuscript that is at once art, sacred object, and cultural heritage. Its tale mirrors the story of its scattered community as Armenians have struggled to redefine themselves after genocide and in the absence of a homeland. Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh follows in the manuscript's footsteps through seven centuries, from medieval Armenia to the killing fields of 1915 Anatolia, the refugee camps of Aleppo, Ellis Island, and Soviet Armenia, and ultimately to a Los Angeles courtroom. </p> <p>Reconstructing the path of the pages, Watenpaugh uncovers the rich tapestry of an extraordinary artwork and the people touched by it. At once a story of genocide and survival, of unimaginable loss and resilience, <i>The Missing Pages</i> captures the human costs of war and persuasively makes the case for a human right to art.</p></p><p><b>Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh</b> is Professor of Art History at the University of California, Davis. She is the award-winning author of <i>The Image of an Ottoman City: Architecture in Aleppo</i> (2004). Her writing has also appeared in the <i>Huffington Post</i> and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>."In <i>The Missing Pages</i>, Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh tells the gripping story of the Zeytun Gospels, a 'survivor object' that bears the traces of centuries of Armenian history and culture. Moving across eras and national borders, Watenpaugh's powerful narrative offers a unique perspective on the fate of cultural heritage in the face of genocide and denial. An essential book for all who are concerned with art, human rights, and post-traumatic resilience." (Michael Rothberg <i>author of <i>Multidirectional Memory: Remembering the Holocaust in the Age of Decolonization</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>The Missing Pages</i> is a well-told tale of the history of the Armenian people. Heghnar Watenpaugh takes us on a wondrous and terrifically engrossing journey of this sacred religious object and priceless work of art." (Michael Bazyler <i>author of <i>Holocaust Justice: The Battle for Restitution in America's Courts</i></i>)<br><br>"[Watenpaugh's] book alerts us to the urgent moral and political questions still to be addressed even in the rarefied world of the museum and the library: she forces us to attend to the human agonies, cultural calamities, and moral ambiguities that lie behind many apparently tranquil museum exhibits." (Eamon Duffy <i><i>The New York Review of Books</i></i>)<br><br>"[A] gripping, and at times unsettling, history of what is known as the Zeytun Gospels, a lavishly illuminated Armenian book that miraculously survived centuries of war, conquest and dispossession.In addition to supplying an important account of a celebrated object, Ms. Watenpaugh has written an impassioned polemic. She invites us to consider how the 'power of curation,' as well as the publicity and wealth attendant upon modern museum culture, can transform an object of specific liturgical use into a highly valued work of art, and what that might mean for all involved." (Ernest Hilbert <i><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></i>)<br><br>"In this compelling and original work, Heghnar Watenpaugh traces the dramatic and epic journey of a sacred work of art. <i>The Missing Pages</i> brings together an understanding of the deeper layers of culture and history with the ethical issues surrounding art, identity, and ownership." (Peter Balakian <i>author of <i>The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response</i></i>)<br><br>"In the fracturing of the Zeytun Gospels, Heghnar Watenpaugh captures the everlasting violence of genocide as it shears and slices into human lives across time and place. Written with both erudition and passion, <i>The Missing Pages</i> is a labor of love and a must-read for anyone concerned with the human right to art." (Fatma M�ge G��ek <i>author of <i>Denial of Violence: Ottoman Past, Turkish Present, and Collective Violence against the Armenians, 1789-2009</i></i>)<br><br>"Heghnar Watenpaugh writes with colorful prose and deep historical texture. <i>The Missing Pages</i> adds much to how we understand the written word in medieval Armenia, as well as the tragic events surrounding the Genocide itself." (Eric Bogosian <i>author of <i>Operation Nemesis: The Assassination Plot that Avenged the Armenian Genocide</i></i>)<br><br>"Heghnar Watenpaugh is a superb scholar and rare sleuth. But what makes <i>The Missing Pages</i> truly remarkable is her gift of storytelling. This is a book with the soul of language&#x2015;moving, affirming, illuminating."

Wearied by the effort, he fell asleep at his desk. What he dreamt would fundamentally change the way we see the world.<br><br> Framing this history is the life story of the nineteenth-century Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleyev, who fell asleep at his desk and awoke after conceiving the periodic table in a dream-the template upon which modern chemistry is founded and the formulation of which marked chemistry's coming of age as a science. From ancient philosophy through medieval alchemy to the splitting of the atom, this is the true story of the birth of chemistry and the role of one man's dream.<br><br> In this elegant, erudite, and entertaining book, Paul Strathern unravels the quixotic history of chemistry through the quest for the elements.</p><p>Paul Strathern is a Somerset Maugham Award&#x2013;winning novelist, and his nonfiction works include The Venetians,&nbsp;Death in Florence, and The Medici, all available from Pegasus Books.

It&#x2019;s a pleasure to find a popular book about chemistry.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New Scientist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Despite its title, this is not a biography of Dmitri Mendeleyev. Rather, it is a lay reader&#x2019;s history of chemistry or, more broadly, scientific thought, from the ancient Greeks through the 19th century.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Strathern does an excellent job revitalizing the drama of chemistry&#x2019;s volatile mix of ideas and substances.

This chapter will offer ideas and strategies to help you get off to a solid start, as well as dodge common pitfalls. </p> <p><b>Where Do You Want to Go?</b> </p> <p>A useful starting point is to ask yourself what you hope to accomplish. Do you want to learn more about the origins of your surname or everything you can about your family tree? Is your goal to identify all eight of your great-grandparents, all sixteen great-great-grandparents, or as many ancestors as possible? </p> <p>Many are simply curious about the entertaining stories that might be found dangling from the branches of their family tree. ... Finding an ancestor who missed the <i>Titanic</i> because of illness or helped build the Erie Canal will suddenly produce an insatiable thirst for knowledge about topics that seemed beyond tedious in your high school history textbooks. </p> <p>How long will all this take? That&#x2019;s up to you. There&#x2019;s always another ancestor to research if you feel like it, and many enjoy the thrill of the hunt so much that they never want it to end. </p> <p><b>Go on a Treasure Hunt</b> </p> <p>Now&#x2019;s a good time to rediscover your own home. Most of us are clueless about all the treasures and tidbits lurking in our closets, drawers, basements, and attics. Many a genealogist has been chagrined to finally determine an elusive ancestor&#x2019;s name after a year of research, only to find this same information in a suitcase of papers tucked into the corner of their own cellar. One of the best possible hauls? A stash of old letters&#x2014;bonus points if they still have their envelopes with precious names and addresses. Other items to keep your eyes open for include: </p> <ul> <li>Birth, marriage, and death certificates </li><li>Newspaper clippings, including obituaries and wedding and anniversary announcements </li><li>Naturalization and citizenship papers, including passports and visas </li><li>Religious records (e.g., baptismal, Bar Mitzvah, etc.) </li><li>Family Bible </li><li>Diaries and journals </li><li>Photo albums (especially photos with the name of the photography studio imprinted or details written on back) </li><li>Heirlooms such as engraved items, samplers, and quilts </li></ul> <p>Genealogy guru Loretto Szucs offers even more ideas in &#x201c;Lou&#x2019;s 300 Family History Sources Checklist&#x201d; (go to AncestryMagazine.com, enter &#x201c;Lou&#x2019;s 300&#x201d; in the search field, and click on &#x201c;Home Sources&#x201d;). After you&#x2019;re done poking through your own hiding places, you might want to see if Mom is willing to let you have a look at hers. (Hint: When scavenging for pieces of your family&#x2019;s past, play the odds by starting with the women; we tend to be the hoarders or protectors, depending on your perspective.) </p> <p><b>Living Libraries</b> </p> <p>Once you&#x2019;re done looking through Mom&#x2019;s attic, you might want to sit down and talk with her. For that matter, if you have any relatives even twenty minutes older than you, stop reading right now and pick up the phone! What these living libraries can tell you off the top of their heads can shave months off your research time. </p> <p>You&#x2019;ll want to give some thought to your questions in advance. There are plenty of resources to help you develop a list of likely topics (you&#x2019;ll find some in the appendix), and the more specific you can be, the better; Older relatives often take the information that lives in their brains for granted and have a tendency to assume you already know what they know. Out of consideration, they&#x2019;ll try to avoid &#x201c;boring&#x201d; you, so you can easily wind up missing all sorts of genealogical gems. </p> <p><b>Chart Your Way</b> </p> <p>The easiest way [organize your new treasures] is to create a chart that&#x2019;s often referred to as a family tree. Fortunately, you have plenty of options for doing this. While I started back in the Dark Ages with paper, I strongly recommend that you take advantage of software and online tree services (see the appendix for popular alternatives). They make it easy to modify your entries over time and keep track of all the relationships (trust me, you don&#x2019;t want to try to keep third cousins twice removed straight in your head&#x2014;and incidentally, we&#x2019;ll explain &#x201c;<i>nth</i> cousins <i>x</i> times removed&#x201d; in chapter 7, &#x201c;The Best of the Rest&#x201d;). </p> <p>Start by entering your own details&#x2014;full name, the date and place of your birth, marriage date and place. Incidentally, all women are listed by their maiden names, partly because you&#x2019;ll need that information to find records pertaining to them before they married. Once you&#x2019;re done with yourself, repeat this process for your parents. If you&#x2019;re doing a family tree for your children, you can start with them and add yourself and your spouse as their parents. </p> <p>Many are able to record bits and pieces, but it&#x2019;s not at all unusual to get stumped on Grandma&#x2019;s maiden name. If this happens to you, don&#x2019;t worry. Just enter what you know for now. If you&#x2019;re estimating (say, you recall your grandfather passing away in the 1970s, but don&#x2019;t remember when), enter the information, but...Try a date range (1970&#x2013;1979) or put &#x201c;abt&#x201d; (about) or &#x201c;circa&#x201d; in front of the date. Later when you find proof of the exact date, you&#x2019;ll be able to update it, but in the meantime, it can help remind you of the rough time period to research. </p> <p>If the documents you&#x2019;ve dug up make it possible to go back further than your grandparents, keep going. </p> <p>It&#x2019;s also a good idea to add as many siblings as you can. Down the road, this will help your research considerably and make it easier to fit in the assorted cousins you&#x2019;ll find along the way. </p> <p>While you can download family tree and family group sheet forms (see the appendix for links), all genealogy software and most online tree services will automatically generate them for you. Both will help you spot the gaps&#x2014;missing ancestors or events&#x2014;and give you a road map for your beyond-the-family research. </p></p><h2>Lakeside Cottage</h2><p>If you trust your heart, you'll always know who you are...&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Each summer, Kate Livingston returns to her family's lakeside cottage, a place of simple living and happy times&#x2014;a place where she hopes her son, Aaron, can blossom.

Christmas Eve</em><br><br>THE AMBULANCE BACKING into the bay of Building One looked like any other rig. It appeared to be returning from a routine transport run, perhaps moving a patient to the step-down unit, or a stabilized trauma victim to Lowery Wing for surgery. The rig had its customary clearance tags for getting through security with a minimum of hassle, and the crew wore the usual crisply creased navy trousers and regulation parkas, ID tags dangling from their pockets. Even the patient looked ordinary in every respect, in standard-issue hospital draping, thermal blankets and an O2 mask.<br><br>Special Forces Medical Sergeant Jordan Donovan Harris wouldn't have given the crew a second glance, except that he was bored and had wandered over to Shaw Wing, to the glassed-in observation deck on the mezzanine level. From there, he could view the ambulance bays and beyond that, Rock Creek Park and Georgia Avenue. The trees were bare and stark black against a blanket of snow, ink drawings on white paper. Traffic trundled along streets that led to the gleaming domes and spires of the nation's capital. A fresh dusting of powder over the 147-acre compound gave the Georgian brick buildings of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center a timeless, frozen, Christmas-card look. Only the activity at the intake bays hinted that the campus housed the military's highest level of patient care.<br><br>Although there was no one around, Harris knew he was being watched. There were more security cameras here than in a Las Vegas casino. It didn't matter to him, though. He had nothing to hide.<br><br>Boredom was desirable in the life of a paramedic. The fact that he was idle meant nothing had gone wrong, no one's world had been shattered by a motor-vehicle accident, an unfortunate fall, a spiking fever, an enraged lover with a gun. For the time being, no one needed saving. Yet for a medic, whose job was to save people, that meant there was nothing to do.<br><br>He shifted his stance, grimacing a little. His dress shoes pinched. All personnel present wore dress uniform today because the President was on the premises to visit ailing soldiers and spread holiday cheer. Of course, only a lucky few actually saw the Commander-in-Chief when he visited. His rounds were carefully orchestrated by the powers that be, and his entourage of Secret Service agents and the official press corps kept him walled off from ordinary people.<br><br>So Harris was a bit startled when he saw a large cluster of black suits and military brass exiting the main elevator below the mezzanine. Odd. The usual route for official visits encompassed Ward 57, where so many wounded veterans lay.<br><br>Today it seemed the tour would include the in-processing unit, which had recently undergone renovations courtesy of a generous party donor.<br><br>The visitors flowed along a spotless corridor. Instinctively, Harris stiffened his spine and prepared to snap to, not that anyone would notice whether or not he did. Old habits died hard.<br><br>He let himself relax a little. From his glassed-in vantage point, he craned his neck for a glimpse of the world leader but saw only the press and bustle of the entourage, led by the sergeant major of the army. A moment later, a civilian administrator greeted everyone with a wide smile. She looked as gracious and welcoming as a Georgetown hostess. Apparently, her domain was on the itinerary and she appeared eager to point out its excellence.<br><br>Harris knew that her name was Darnelle Jefferson and that she had worked here for a quarter of a century. She was fond of telling that to anyone who would listen. Looking at her, you'd never guess what the regulars here knew-that like many civilian administrators, she tended to spend her entire day being a pain in the ass to all personnel and creating a mountain of paperwork to justify her own existence. Still, she looked cheerful and efficient in a Christmas-red dress with the requisite yellow ribbon pinned to her bosom, and the wattage of her smile increased as the impossible occurred. The President separated from the pack and stepped forward for a photo op.<br><br>Then, even more surprisingly, Mrs. Jefferson took charge of the tour, leading the group along the wide, gleaming corridor. Two cameramen trolled along beside them, the big lenses of their cameras capturing every movement and nuance for the nightly news. The party stopped off at the first intake room, where a wounded soldier had arrived from another facility.<br><br>Harris knew that the official photos and film would portray the President with the soldier and his family in an intimate circle around the hospital bed. The pictures wouldn't show the vigilant Secret Service, or the booms and mikes hovering just out of sight.<br><br>That's showbiz, thought Harris. He didn't understand how anyone could put up with public life. To have everyone's scrutiny on you was a peculiar sort of torture, as far as he was concerned.<br><br>The entourage was on the move again, down the scrubbed hallway toward the Talbot Lounge, one of the newly renovated waiting areas, where a twelve-foot noble fir stood, decked in splendor by one of D.C.'s finest florists. They stopped for more photos. Harris could see flashes going off, but he'd lost sight of the President.<br><br>Elsewhere in the same wing, the recently delivered patient lay in an intake room flanked on two sides by wire-embedded glass walls. The transport crew had gone to the main desk to fill out their report, and no hospital personnel had arrived yet to in-process the newcomer. The staff members on duty were probably just like Harris, slacking off as they tried to get a look at the President. The patient lay alone, no family member or friend standing by to comfort him in this strange new world. Some people just didn't have anybody. Harris himself might be a prime example of that, if not for Schroeder. He and Sam Schroeder had been best friends for years, since meeting in a battle zone in Konar Province, Afghanistan. Sam and his family made up all that was important to Harris, and he told himself it was enough.<br><br>He took the stairs down to the main level, hoping to get a look at the President's face. He didn't know why. Maybe it was the fact that he'd spent a decade serving this country and another four years at the hospital, keeping people from dying. He sure as hell ought to be able to catch a glimpse of the President up close. A memo had advised that there would be a reception later at the hospital rec center-with the Gatlin Brothers performing-but that was sure to be a mob scene.<br><br>A pair of marines in dress blues stood sentinel at the double doors to the unit. Harris gestured with his clipboard and flashed his ID, projecting an air of brisk efficiency. Once inside the unit, he had to act busy or they'd know he was loitering in order to see the President, a practice that was frowned upon.<br><br>Harris stopped outside the admittance room where the new arrival lay. He took a chart from the U-shaped holder on the door, flipped up the metal cover and pretended to be studying it.<br><br>The sound of footsteps and voices grew louder as the presidential party approached.<br><br>"...new Cardiothoracic Stepdown Unit is equipped with state-of-the-art monitoring equipment," Mrs. Jefferson explained in broad, grave tones. "It's now our country's leading center of clinical care, research and evaluation..." She droned on as though reading from a prepared script, and Harris tuned her out.<br><br>The party drew closer. Finally Harris caught a glimpse of the Commander-in-Chief. His expression was set in his trademark look of compassion. The President and the hospital administrator separated from the group. Darnelle Jefferson led the way toward the in-processing unit where the new arrival lay.<br><br>Damn, thought Harris, time to disappear. Quickly-but not too quickly-he slipped into an admit room, connected to the unit by a set of green swinging doors. By looking through the round portals, he could see straight through to the next two rooms. He focused on the new patient through the glass, expecting him to be lying there quiet and alone, probably scared shitless, unaware that the President of the United States was just a few steps away.<br><br>Except that the guy wasn't quiet. For a cardiac patient, he seemed awfully busy, sitting up on the gurney, tearing away his mask.<br><br>Harris studied the chart he'd grabbed from the rack outside the door. Terence Lee Muldoon. He was a combat vet, a transferee from a U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany. The chart listed him as twenty-five years old-damn young for heart trouble.<br><br>In his time, Harris had seen thousands of cardiac patients. The condition was always characterized by a grayish pallor and palpable look of fatigue.<br><br>Not this character. Even from a distance and through two sets of doors, Harris could see that his face was a healthy pink, his movements economical and assured.<br><br>At that moment, the entourage stopped in the corridor and the President and Mrs. Jefferson entered Muldoon's room. The glassed-in cubicle was too small to accommodate more visitors, and the bodyguards hovered outside, craning their necks, their gazes constantly on the move, their lips murmuring into their hidden radios. A pair of photographers pressed their camera lenses against the glass. The President greeted Muldoon with a handshake, then moved behind the gurney for the requisite photo op.<br><br>There was never a specific moment when Harris decided something was wrong. He never saw a maniacal gleam in the impostor's eyes or heard some sort of evil cackle like in the movies. Real evil didn't work that way. It was all quite...or-dinary.<br><br>Sweet baby Moses, thought Harris.<br><br>There was also never a particular moment when Harris decided to take action. Making a decision implied a thought process that simply didn't happen. Harris-and the unsuspecting President-had no time for that. Flipping the silent alert signal on his shoulder-mounted radio, he slipped through the double doors into the next in-processing room, adjacent to where the President was. He knew the security cameras were recording his movements, but the stranger next door didn't appear to have noticed him.<br><br>Harris refrained from shouting or making any sudden movements. The patient was not yet aware of him, and he didn't want to draw attention to himself. He had to move fast, though, because his movements were going to look highly suspicious to the security cameras. Those watching him were going to think he was a nutcase or worse-a bad guy.<br><br>The flow of events unfolded with a peculiar inevitability. Later-much, much later-Harris would watch the videos made by both the security monitors and the press corps, but he would remember none of it.<br><br>Seconds before the personnel in the hallway responded to the alert, the patient swept aside the thermal blanket. With his free hand, he yanked away the gown to reveal rows of dynamite duct taped to a body-hugging vest.<br><br>"Anybody takes me out," he screamed at the glass wall, "and I go up like the Fourth ofJuly. And I take this whole wing of the building with me." He leaped to the floor and glared at the horrified crowd on the other side of the glass. His fist closed around the igniter, ready to detonate the explosives.<br><br>The President stood stock-still. Darnelle Jefferson gave a hiccuping gasp of sheer terror. Harris froze, too experienced to let fear get in the way. He recognized the shield tattooed on Muldoon's forearm. It was the iron falcon and sword of a Special Forces unit.<br><br>So they were dealing with a rogue from Special Forces, as highly trained as Harris himself, a disciplined killer gone awry. The assassin hadn't seen him yet. He was strutting in front of the wire-embedded glass while a dozen firearms were aimed at him.<br><br>Harris studied the homemade explosive vest and wondered how the hell the transport crew had failed to notice it. The explosives appeared to be plastic ordnance with an igniter operated by a toggle mechanism secured with more duct tape and connected to wires that would activate the explosives. It would have to be detonated manually, unless there was a secondary trigger he wasn't seeing.<br><br>Outside the cubicle, bodyguards and marines broke into action. Honed by countless drills, procedure would be followed to the letter. There would be an immediate lockdown, all units would come to full alert and alarms would shriek across the vast, snowy campus of Walter Reed. Even now, a security squadron was probably surrounding the building.<br><br>Mrs. Jefferson made a tiny sound for such a big woman and fainted dead away, taking a Lifepak monitor along with her. It crashed to the floor, startling Muldoon, and Harris was sure he'd spook and ignite the explosives. His left hand, which had been gripping the manual trigger, let go momentarily as he regrouped.<br><br>Darnelle had given Harris a seconds-long window of opportunity. Knowing he had a chance was all he needed. It was only one chance, though. If he blew it, they were all toast. Or confetti, more accurately.<br><br>He burst through the double doors, everything focused on the assailant's trigger hand. His entire body launched itself at the assassin in a single-move tactic, one he'd been trained for but had never used until now.<br><br>Muldoon went down, screaming as Harris crushed the man's left wrist to disable his hand. They hit the floor together. Muldoon was shocky from the crushed wrist. That was something.<br><br>There was a sound like a rifle shot. Harris felt something hit him like a cannonball. Jesus, had the son of a bitch detonated the explosives?<br><br>No, the igniter, Harris realized. The impact had triggered it, but it had misfired. That was the good news. The bad news was, the failed explosion was killing him. His limbs went immediately ice cold as if everything had been sucked out of him. He was aware of movement all around, the President taking cover, the frenzy of highly trained Secret Service men jolted into action. Alarms bayed and someone was screaming. A furious ringing sound blared in his ears. The reek of chemicals seared his throat.<br><br>The world dissolved into double images as Harris's consciousness seeped away like the blood on the floor. Sounds stretched out with an eerie echo, as though shouted down a well. "Freeze.. <em>freeze,freeze...."</em> The barked order reverberated through Harris's head. "Nobody move! <em>oove, oove...."</em><br><br>Harris's pulse was thready. Lying in a widening pool of blood, he imagined each system shutting down, one by one, a theater's lights going dim after a final performance. He felt himself quiver, or maybe it was the assassin struggling against him. To die like this, he thought, at the President's feet. That just sucked. Offended his sense of propriety. Sure, it wouldn't matter to him after he was gone. It shouldn't matter at all, but somehow it did.<br><br>Harris could see his own reflection in the dome of the 360-degree security camera mounted in the ceiling. Blood spreading out like an inky carpet. It always looks worse than it is, he told himself. He said that to his patients all the time.<br><br>The swarm descended, a pandemonium of black suits and dress uniforms as the Secret Service came forward to apprehend the crazy and secure the chief executive.<br><br>Harris was cold and headed somewhere dark. He could feel himself slipping, falling into a black well.<br><br>"Make way," a loud voice barked, the words echoing, then fading. "Somebody get this man some help."<br><br></p><h2>In Time: The Killing of Polly Paul</h2><p><p>On the summer evening of Wednesday, June 7, 1865, just two months after the end of the Civil War, seventy-one-year-old local farmer and weaver Polly Paul and her seventeen-year-old apprentice Cassie Munday were brutally slain in cold blood at the Paul farm outside Summerhill, Pennsylvania.

The monkey is not alone. A lion, a jackal, a turtle, and a dove bicker in the cramped space, until a statue of Buddha comes to life. "Hush, children, hush." Buddha says. "I will tell you a story to pass the time." From the tale of the clever monkey outwitting a hungry crocodile to that of a bird and turtle rescuing a friend, the six amusing parables told by the Buddha will introduce young readers to the famous cycle of fables in Buddhist literature known as the Jatakas, or birth stories, which Buddha originally told to his disciples to illustrate his teachings. Joined with stunning linocut illustrations, Jeanne M. Lee's <i>I Once Was a Monkey </i>form a book notable for both its beauty and its wisdom.</p></p><p><p><b>Jeanne M. Lee</b> is the author and illustrator of many books, including <i>The Song of Mu Lan</i> and <i>Silent Lotus</i>. She lives in Massachusetts.</p>A monkey that takes refuge in the ruins of Buddha's temple during a monsoon sets the stage for these finely honed retellings of six Jatakas, or birth stories. As the monkey's eyes adjust to the light, he discovers he is in the company of a lion, turtle, jackal and dove, and a statue of "the Enlightened One" begins to speak. In each tale, Buddha assumes a different shape to impart his message of peace, attentiveness, tolerance and respect. Lee (The Song of Mu Lan) effortlessly and subtly weaves Buddhist practices and principles into her evenly paced tales. Each story is a study in brevity and restraint yet, like Buddha, conveys enormous empathy. For instance, after a heron, in a deceptive ploy, consumes all the fish in a lake, a crab outwits him then makes his way back to the water, "weeping all the while for his lost friends." Lee draws the frame story in black-and-white, with Buddha in teaching posture and the animals listening attentively. The full-color illustrations for each Jataka combine the strength of woodcuts and the fluidity of Chinese silk painting, with their serene landscapes in soft colors and confident black lines; the full-spread illustration of a lion heading off a stampede of animals bound for danger is especially moving. Fans of Aesop's fables and the Just So Stories will likely find these characters equally as compelling, while others will discover a gentle and graceful introduction to Buddhism here.

Clear, cogent, compelling analyses of the tension between the 'social model' of disability and the material details of impairment; of identity politics and unstable identities; of capability rights and human interdependence; of disability and law, disability as masquerade, disability and sexuality, disability and democracy---they're all here, in beautifully crafted and intellectually startling essays. <i>Disability Theory</i> is a field-defining book: and if you're curious about what 'disability' has to do with 'theory,' it's just the book you've been waiting for, too."<br> ---Michael B�rub�, Pennsylvania State University</p> <p>"<i>Disability Theory</i> is magisterially written, thoroughly researched, and polemically powerful. It will be controversial in a number of areas and will probably ruffle feathers both in disability studies as well as in realms of cultural theory. And that's all to the good."<br> ---Michael Davidson, University of California, San Diego</p> <p>"Not only is <i>Disability Theory</i> a groundbreaking contribution to disability studies, it is also a bold, ambitious and much needed revision to a number of adjacent and overlapping fields including cultural studies, literary theory, queer theory, and critical race studies.

Tobin Siebers persuasively argues that disability studies transfigures basic assumptions about identity, ideology, language, politics, social oppression, and the body. At the same time, he advances the emerging field of disability studies by putting its core issues into contact with signal thinkers in cultural studies, literary theory, queer theory, gender studies, and critical race theory.</p> <p>Tobin Siebers is V.

Their lives were shattered by Nazi cruelty, prejudice and devastation. <strong><em>Hidden Recipes</em></strong> tells the story of their will and determination, and their struggles to survive. By sharing stories about their lives when food was abundant before the war, Ica secretly wrote down hundreds of recipes that she and her fellow inmates shared. Ironically, many of the delectable recipes were written on the reverse sides of papers that carried information about ammunition that was manufactured and used to annihilate the Jews during the Holocaust. Ern&#x151; spent several years in various Hungarian forced labor units, where he was required to perform strenuous manual labor. He courageously escaped with the help of righteous people, which saved his life.</p><p><strong><em>Hidden Recipes</em></strong> is a story of endurance, will to survive, courage, faith and finding joy and happiness again. </p></p><p>Eva Moreimi grew up in Czechoslovakia as an only child to two Holocaust survivor parents. Shortly after graduating from Economic School, she escaped from the communist regime and immigrated to the United States. She lives in the Midwest with her husband close to their three children and six grandchildren.<p>"Eva Moreimi movingly tells the story of her family, her father Ernest, slave laborer in German Allied Hungary, her mother Ica and Aunt Babi and their journey from a life of comfort into the world of Auschwitz, their survival and liberation and then their journey back from the abyss...Read the book and be moved by the story of courage and determination, loss and dehumanization but also the struggle to resist both physical and spiritual annihilation. Bake from these Hidden Recipes but only if you make two commitments: Serve these cakes on a joyous occasion -- these women suffered enough...Above all, tell their story for they must be remembered."</p><p><strong>--Michael Berenbaum, Director of the Sigi Ziering Institute, Professor of Jewish Studies, American Jewish University</strong></p><p> </p><p>"From courage to cuisine, this incredible story shows how the best of humanity can survive in the darkest of times. Hidden Recipes captures not only an amazing story of Ica's heroism and survival, but a story of struggle and redemption as scraps of paper will keep alive the memories of joy for generations to come."</p><p><strong>--Steve Isakowitz, Space Industry Executive, Child of Holocaust Survivors</strong></p><p> </p><p>"Hidden Recipes is a loving tribute to Elena and Ernest Kalina by their daughter Eva. Elena's recipes are a legacy to her family and an honor to those women who shared their favorite dishes with her in the camp. Because of her act of resistance these women will live on through their recipes."</p><p><strong>--Jodi Elowitz, Director of Education, Nancy &amp; David Wolf Holocaust &amp; Humanity Center</strong></p><p> </p><p>"Eva Moreimi's book is a unique Holocaust survival story. In the most unlikely of places, while starving, the women shared with Ica, the author's mother, their most precious family recipes. Ica risked everything to scribble down the recipes, and in an act of defiance and a quest to preserve her culture, she hid them. A fascinating story of uncanny coincidence and serendipity, resilience and defiance."</p><p><strong>--Janet Horvath, Cellist, Child of Holocaust Survivors, Author of Playing (Less) Hurt and her upcoming memoir, Piercing the Silence</strong></p></p><h2>101 Ukulele Licks: Essential Blues, Jazz, Country, Bluegrass, and Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Licks for the Uke</h2><p>(Ukulele).

Visit mirandakenneally.comGr 9 Up&#x2014;Seventeen-year-old Taylor Lukens has life all figured out. Captain of her soccer team, president of the debate team, and daughter of a Tennessee senator, she dreams of early acceptance to Yale. However, she gets expelled from her prestigious boarding school after she takes the fall for her Adderall-dealing boyfriend. Before Taylor knows it, she's back at home and starting over at Hundred Oaks High, friendless and forced to play defense on the soccer team that used to be her rival. Torn apart by the damage that she's done to her father's reelection campaign and her relationship with her parents, the teen refuses to tell the world that she is innocent, thinking that her father will view her as a snitch, the worst fate of all. But then she reconnects with her old crush, Ezra Carmichael, and he inspires her to question all of the truths that she has held dear. On the surface, this work presents itself as a formulaic yet totally enjoyable summer read. However, this title has depth. Kenneally frankly discusses the realities of Adderall, Ritalin, and other drugs, and the sexually charged relationship between Taylor and Ezra feels authentic and unique compared with the cookie-cutter teen romances that this volume initially seems to resemble.

In a gripping historical narrative, Pamela S. Nadell weaves together the stories of a diverse group of extraordinary people&#x2015;from the colonial-era matriarch Grace Nathan and her great-granddaughter, poet Emma Lazarus, to labor organizer Bessie Hillman and the great justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to scores of other activists, workers, wives, and mothers who helped carve out a Jewish American identity.</p><p>The twin threads binding these women together, she argues, are a strong sense of self and a resolute commitment to making the world a better place. Nadell recounts how Jewish women have been at the forefront of causes for centuries, fighting for suffrage, trade unions, civil rights, and feminism, and hoisting banners for Jewish rights around the world. Informed by shared values of America&#x2019;s founding and Jewish identity, these women&#x2019;s lives have left deep footprints in the history of the nation they call home.</p> 20 black and white illustrations</p><p>Pamela S.

The symbols were employed to mislead the profane and to make more effective and comprehensive the instruction of the elect concerning the mysteries of Life and Cosmic Spirit. The scientific religion of the Masters (1) taught that the human body is the Temple in which the Cosmic Spirit dwells on the earth place, and instructed man how to care for his body while it was animated by the Holy Spirit, and also (2) revealed the mystery of the Future Life when the body ceases its function and dissolves into dust.</p><p></p><h2>Agatha Raisin: Something Borrowed, Someone Dead [Jan 05, 2017] Beaton, M.

Born in Scotland, she currently divides her time between the English Cotswolds and Paris.</p>Some people love an English cream tea, in which clotted cream is lavished on crumpets in an artery-threatening way, and some people find cream teas incredibly cloying. Whatever side you&#x2019;re on, you&#x2019;ll recognize the same phenomenon&#x2014;some say scrumptious, some say cloying&#x2014;reading this cozy starring Agatha Raisin, a private eye in the Cotswolds. Beaton just about clobbers her readers over the head with multiple references to &#x201c;the Cotswolds,&#x201d; &#x201c;the neighboring hamlet,&#x201d; &#x201c;the vicar&#x2019;s wife.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s even a lady of the manor, who, we are told, is very much like Maggie Smith as the Dowager Duchess in Downton Abbey. The plot is fairly predictable: a newcomer to a tiny village with a bad habit of &#x201c;borrowing&#x201d; others&#x2019; belongings is found poisoned after drinking some pilfered wine. Agatha moves from pub to vicar&#x2019;s house to manor house, questioning everyone in sight. Although this is set in today&#x2019;s world, it seems very much like the world of the early twentieth century. Beaton&#x2019;s Agatha Raisin series is extremely popular and, often, good fun. This one seems like a too-calculated cozy&#x2014;except for the clotted-cream crowd. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>Vegan Pizza: 50 Cheesy, Crispy, Healthy Recipes</h2><p>Everything you need to know to create delicious, healthy pizza at home without any meat or dairy products.<br><br>&#x201c;Vegans, rejoice&#x2014;Julie Hasson has given pizza a plant-strong makeover.

In <i>Faitheist</i>, Chris Stedman tells his own story to challenge the orthodoxies of this movement and make a passionate argument that atheists should engage religious diversity respectfully.<br>&nbsp;<br>Becoming aware of injustice, and craving community, Stedman became a &#x201c;born-again&#x201d; Christian in late childhood. The idea of a community bound by God&#x2019;s love&#x2014;a love that was undeserved, unending, and guaranteed&#x2014;captivated him. It was, he writes, a place to belong and a framework for making sense of suffering. <br>&nbsp;<br>But Stedman&#x2019;s religious community did not embody this idea of God&#x2019;s love: they were staunchly homophobic at a time when he was slowly coming to realize that he was gay. The great suffering this caused him might have turned Stedman into a life-long New Atheist. But over time he came to know more open-minded Christians, and his interest in service work brought him into contact with people from a wide variety of religious backgrounds. His own religious beliefs might have fallen away, but his desire to change the world for the better remained. Disdain and hostility toward religion was holding him back from engaging in meaningful work with people of faith. And it was keeping him from full relationships with them&#x2014;the kinds of relationships that break down intolerance and improve the world. <br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Faitheist</i>, Stedman draws on his work organizing interfaith and secular communities, his academic study of religion, and his own experiences to argue for the necessity of bridging the growing chasm between atheists and the religious. As someone who has stood on both sides of the divide, Stedman is uniquely positioned to present a way for atheists and the religious to find common ground and work together to make this world&#x2014;the one world we can all agree on&#x2014;a better place.</p><p><p><b>Chris Stedman</b> is the Assistant Humanist Chaplain at Harvard University, the emeritus managing director of State of Formation at the <i>Journal of Inter-Religious Dialogue</i>, and the founder of the first blog dedicated to exploring atheist-interfaith engagement, <i>NonProphet Status</i>. Stedman writes for the <i>Huffington Post</i>, the<i> Washington Post</i>&#x2019;s<i> On Faith </i>blog, and <i>Religion Dispatches</i>. He lives in Boston.</p><b>From Chapter 1</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>There&#x2019;s Nothing Worse Than a Faitheist</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The chief deficiency I see in the skeptical movement is its polarization:</i><br> <i>Us vs. Them&#x2014;the sense that we have a monopoly on the truth; that those other people who believe in all these stupid doctrines are morons; that if you&#x2019;re sensible, you&#x2019;ll listen to us; and if not, to hell with you. This is nonconstructive. It does not get our message across. It condemns us to permanent minority status.</i><br> &#x2014;Carl Sagan<br> &nbsp;<br> I had never heard the word &#x201c;faitheist&#x201d; before, but I was pretty sure it wasn&#x2019;t a compliment.<br> &nbsp;<br> I blushed and ran my hands through my short coffee-colored hair&#x2014;a nervous habit&#x2014;and cleared my throat, asking if it was intended to be an insult.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said without inflection. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing worse than a &#x2018;faitheist.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was my first experience with the atheist movement, and for at least a moment I thought it might be my last. I&#x2019;d been an atheist for a while, but I had hesitated to seek out a community of nonreligious people. I imagined that secular folks would be difficult to organize; that assembling atheists, agnostics, skeptics, freethinkers, and other nonreligious individuals would prove tricky because our common thread&#x2014;that we are <i>not </i>something&#x2014;underscores only what we do <i>not </i>believe. But as I progressed in my work as an interfaith activist, I noticed that one of the things that actually made people good at it was a groundedness in one&#x2019;s own identity. That, paired with my longing for a community of common belief, led me to begin searching for an organized community of nontheists. <br> &nbsp;<br> The brusque brush-off occurred at a reception following a public discussion organized by a nonreligious group; the topic had been how the nonreligious&#x2014;more specifically, atheists, agnostics, and other nontheistic, nonreligious people&#x2014;should approach religion. I had suspected that there would be mixed feelings about religion. After all, I knew of the popular atheist discourse on the subject, which cast the religious not only as incorrect about metaphysical realities but as standing in the way of social and intellectual progress. But I had also hoped that someone might offer a more balanced perspective on religion, locating within the beliefs, desires, and actions of religious people similar values held by many nonreligious people.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had gone with optimism and excitement. At the time, I was both an atheist and an intern for Interfaith Youth Core, an organization that helps mobilize young people to change the public narrative on religion from one of conflict to one of cooperation by engaging in dialogue around shared values and collaborative action. Because of my work, I felt I was in a particularly good position to discuss religion in the lives of nonreligious folks. I pictured myself saying with a well-meaning grin, &#x201c;Hey, I work with religious people every day and my atheism is stronger than ever!&#x201d; I hoped I might even serve as a bridge between two communities that are so oft en pitted against one another, to offer my insights as a nonreligious person working in an interfaith environment.<br> &nbsp;<br> That aspiration was quickly curtailed. Throughout the program, religion&#x2014;and religious people&#x2014;were roundly mocked, decried, and denied. I&#x2019;d arrived hoping to find a community bound by ethical and humanitarian ideals. Instead, I felt isolated and sorely discouraged.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though I was disheartened by the event, I went to the post-panel reception, held at one of the panelists&#x2019; apartments, because I hoped that if I spoke with more of the group members I&#x2019;d find some people who shared my opinions or learn a bit more about why they believed differently than I did. Also, as a thrift y graduate student, free dinner and drinks were hard to pass up!<br> &nbsp;<br> I walked in and instantly removed my shoes. The apartment was beautiful; the ceiling-to-floor windows allowed for a stunning view of Chicago&#x2019;s orange-and-white-lit skyline. The living room was impeccably clean. (I made a mental note to at least shove my dirty laundry in the closet when I got home.) I stood there and scanned the crowd; I was easily the youngest person there and unfashionably underdressed (nothing new there). Looking down at my feet, I noticed there was a hole in each of my socks. <i>Maybe I</i> <i>should&#x2019;ve left my shoes on</i>, I thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> I sat down on the couch, carefully balancing a mint julep in one hand and a plate of hors d&#x2019;oeuvres I couldn&#x2019;t name in the other, intensely aware of how out of place I must have seemed. Next to me on the couch were a woman in her mid-forties with a shimmering peacock brooch and a man in his late thirties wearing a denim shirt and a tan corduroy vest. I introduced myself and asked what they&#x2019;d thought of the panel. They raved: &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t it wonderful how intelligent the panelists were and how wickedly they&#x2019;d exposed the frauds of religion? Weren&#x2019;t they right that we must all focus our energy on bringing about the demise of religious myths?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I paused, debating whether I should say anything. My &#x201c;Minnesota Nice&#x201d; inclination warned me to let it be, but I had to say something. So I started small, asking them to consider that diversity of thought and background fosters an environment where discourse thrives, where ideas are exchanged, and where we learn from one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was stonewalled: &#x201c;We have the superior perspective; everyone else is lost,&#x201d; said the woman with a flick of her hand that suggested she was swatting at an invisible mosquito.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a former Evangelical Christian, these words were hauntingly familiar, and they represented a kind of sure-handed certainty and dismissal&#x2014;a kind of fundamentalist thinking, really&#x2014; that I&#x2019;d hoped to leave behind with my &#x201c;born again&#x201d; beliefs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our conversation continued, and I offered up petitions that the positive contributions of religious people be considered with equal weight alongside the negative. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I understand what you&#x2019;re saying,&#x201d; I said, trying to weigh my words carefully, &#x201c;but how can we discount the role religious beliefs played in motivating the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or<br> Mahatma Gandhi?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, I get it,&#x201d; the man jumped in with a sneer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re one of <i>those </i>atheists.&#x201d;<br> I wasn&#x2019;t sure what he meant, but it didn&#x2019;t sound like a good thing. I shifted my weight from one side to another&#x2014;another nervous habit&#x2014;and picked at an hors d&#x2019;oeuvre that I thought might be some kind of cheese.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;one of <i>those </i>atheists&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not a <i>real </i>atheist. We&#x2019;ve got a name for people like you. You&#x2019;re a &#x2018;faitheist.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Not a <i>real </i>atheist. I&#x2019;d heard words like that before&#x2014;in my youth, when I was told I couldn&#x2019;t be a <i>real </i>Christian because I was gay. Once again I didn&#x2019;t fit the prescribed model, and I was not-so-gently shown the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, atheism is a bit different from Christianity in that atheism isn&#x2019;t a belief system. It&#x2019;s an identification marker that unifies a minority of Americans who do not believe in God. But the implication was clear: you&#x2019;re at the wrong party, kid.<br> &nbsp;<br> The next day, I attended my weekly religion class at Loyola University&#x2019;s Institute of Pastoral Studies, a Jesuit Catholic&#x2013;run program for priests, nuns, and lay leaders. As the only self-identified nonreligious person in the class, I was regularly met with many questions. Once, a Catholic classmate cornered me in the elevator after class, proclaiming, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been dying to ask you about your atheism!&#x201d; Yet it never felt like an affront&#x2014;she and the others were genuinely (and understandably) curious.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sitting in class the day after my botched attempt at seeking secular community, I realized that I felt more at home with my religious colleagues than with the atheists from the day before. I looked around the room, focusing on each individual face; here were people who believed in a God I had theorized away years ago, yet they felt more like kin than most atheists I knew. While my classmates felt that their religious beliefs were right, they not only tolerated my beliefs but also enthusiastically embraced and challenged them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even though many parts of the United States remain incredibly segregated, we live in the most religiously diverse nation on the planet, so one doesn&#x2019;t need to be an atheist enrolled in a Catholic institution to know that many American citizens are by default required to coexist with people who believe radically different things. The question I found myself asking that day, however, went a step beyond that.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was not, &#x201c;Can religiously diverse people coexist in peace?&#x201d;&#x2014; because, with some notable exceptions, Americans generally manage to tolerate one another&#x2019;s differences. It was, instead, &#x201c;Can we learn to seek out our commonalities instead of solely fixating on our differences?&#x201d; This idea that it is worthwhile to make an intentional effort to find common ground is, to me, the difference between mere diversity and engaged pluralism. It is a question that our nation&#x2014;in which a solid majority of Americans associate the extremists of 9/11 with all Muslims&#x2014;is not close to resolving.<br> &nbsp;<br> The challenge of engaged religious diversity&#x2014;of intersecting religious difference&#x2014;is one that atheists know perhaps more intimately than most. In a nation full of believers of all stripes, we are, in a sense, outliers. This is perhaps why so many atheists today ask for equal airtime alongside our religious neighbors&#x2014;we want to be taken seriously, to be seen as equally ethical individuals. The unfortunate side effect is that many atheists demand this at the expense of talking to our religious peers in a way that affords them dignity and respect.<br> &nbsp;<br> Several years ago, Harvard Humanist chaplain Greg Epstein wrote a book called <i>Good Without God</i>, and his thesis was a simple but important one: our society must move beyond the question of <i>if </i>one can be good without God to <i>how </i>this may be accomplished.<br> &nbsp;<br> I join Greg in wanting people to move beyond wondering whether I am a moral individual, but I also join him in a companion call to our own community: atheism must move beyond defining itself&#x2014;both in thought and in practice&#x2014;in opposition to religion. If secular Americans want to be respected in our religiously diverse culture, we need to recognize that there is nuance and complexity in the diversity that defines it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ralph Waldo Emerson, a forefather of modern Humanism, is often said to have written these lines: &#x201c;That which dominates our imaginations and our thoughts will determine our lives and character. Therefore, it behooves us to be careful what we worship, for what we are worshiping we are becoming.&#x201d;</p><h2>Unifying Glory</h2><p>Unifying Glory is the touch of glory that brings a divine joining of brother to brother, a miraculous uniting of the diverse members of the family of God and is the answer to the prayer of Jesus: &#34;That they all may be one.&#34; God is calling us to live in the cloud of His glory, in the smoke of His presence. He wants His people to be known as &#34;The people of the Glory cloud,&#34; not, &#34;the people divided into a thousand denominations.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Of Wolves and Men (Scribner Classics)</h2><p><b>The 1978 classic on man and nature returns in this special twenty-fifth-anniversary edition, featuring a new afterword that assesses how far we&#x2019;ve advanced in our understanding of other creatures and our efforts to conserve the environment.</b><br><br>Humankind's relationship with the wolf is the sum of a spectrum of responses ranging from fear to admiration and affection. Lopez&#x2019;s classic, careful study won praise from a wide range of reviewers, became a finalist for the National Book award, and forever improved the way books on wild animals are written. <i>Of Wolves and Men</i> explores the uneasy interaction between wolves and civilization over the centuries, and the wolf's prominence in our thoughts about wild creatures. Drawing upon an impressive array of literature, history, science, and mythology as well as extensive personal experience with captive and free-ranging wolves, Lopez argues for the wolf's preservation and immerses the reader in its sensory world, creating a compelling portrait of the wolf both as a real animal and as imagined by different kinds of men. A scientist might perceive the wolf as defined by research data, while an Eskimo hunter sees a family provider much like himself. For many Native Americans the wolf is also a spiritual symbol, a respected animal that can strengthen the individual and the community. With irresistible charm and elegance, <i>Of Wolves and Men</i> celebrates careful scientific fieldwork, dispels folklore that has enabled the Western mind to demonize wolves, explains myths, and honors indigenous traditions, allowing us to understand how this remarkable animal has become so prominent for so long in the human heart.</p><p>"The wolf exerts a powerful influence on the human imagination. It takes your stare and turns it back on you." So Barry Lopez writes in his first major work of nonfiction, a careful study of the way that wolves and humans have interacted over centuries, and the way that the wolf has become so central to our thinking about animals. Drawing on considerable personal experience with wolves and on an astonishing range of literature, Lopez argues for the necessity of wolves in the world, which would be much poorer without their howl. Thanks in part to the influence of this essential book about <i>Canis lupus</i>, first published in 1978, we know a great deal more about wolves and are all the better prepared to assure their protection.<b>Barry Lopez</b>'s books include<i> Light Action in the Caribbean</i> (stories), <i>About This Life</i> (essays and memoir), the novella-length fable <i>Crow and Weasel</i>, and <i>Arctic Dreams</i> (nonfiction), for which he received the National Book Award.

But such simple actions are structured by complex relationships with our natural world. The contours of these relationships&#x2015;social, cultural, political, economic, and legal&#x2015;were established during America&#x2019;s first great period of urbanization in the nineteenth century, and Boston, one of the earliest cities in America, often led the nation in designing them. A richly textured cultural and social history of the development of nineteenth-century Boston, this book provides a new environmental perspective on the creation of America&#x2019;s first cities.</p><p><i>Eden on the Charles</i> explores how Bostonians channeled country lakes through miles of pipeline to provide clean water; dredged the ocean to deepen the harbor; filled tidal flats and covered the peninsula with houses, shops, and factories; and created a metropolitan system of parks and greenways, facilitating the conversion of fields into suburbs. The book shows how, in Boston, different class and ethnic groups brought rival ideas of nature and competing visions of a &#x201c;city upon a hill&#x201d; to the process of urbanization&#x2015;and were forced to conform their goals to the realities of Boston&#x2019;s distinctive natural setting. The outcomes of their battles for control over the city&#x2019;s development were ultimately recorded in the very fabric of Boston itself. In Boston&#x2019;s history, we find the seeds of the environmental relationships that&#x2015;for better or worse&#x2015;have defined urban America to this day.</p></p><p>Michael Rawson is Associate Professor of History at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.&#x201c;In <i>Eden on the Charles: The Making of Boston</i>, Michael Rawson examines how the city&#x2019;s relationship with its natural surroundings informed its early growth and development. His compelling, well-researched narrative touches on several milestones on Boston&#x2019;s road to modernity, including the Common&#x2019;s conversion from a place of labor to a place of leisure, the emergence of pastoral suburbs as a respite from an increasingly urbanized landscape, and the long fight over a proposed municipal water system to bring fresh water to those who needed it most... Perhaps the book&#x2019;s most important lesson comes from a frustrated mariner who, upset over the maltreatment of the harbor, laments that &#x2018;the past seems to be forgotten, the present only is regarded as of importance, and a veil is drawn over the future.&#x2019; <i>Eden on the Charles</i> is a valiant effort to combat such shortsightedness, reminding us that the key to building a successful community lies in respecting the natural resources that provide for it and in understanding our responsibility to our fellow citizens.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Patrick Brady</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Rawson examines the city of Boston in the 19th century and how its inhabitants constructed not only a city, but also a new way of looking at the connection between people and the natural world that defined what it means to be urban... The author focuses on how Bostonians transformed Boston Common into a public park, created one of the earliest U.S. urban water systems, and helped invent the idea of the pastoral suburb. This urban case study explores the changing nature of environmental relationships and the leading role that the city of Boston played in the process. As such, this readable work makes a valuable contribution to urban historiography.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>T. A. Aiello</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;By tracing the myriad shifting connections between Bostonians and the natural environments that have sustained their lives, Rawson&#x2019;s <i>Eden on the Charles</i> offers vital new perspectives on the human place in nature and how people think about it&#x2015;not just for Boston, but for all American cities, past, present, and future.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Cronon, author of <i>Nature&#x2019;s Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In lucid prose and engaging detail, Rawson charts how nineteenth-century Bostonians struggled with nature and one another to craft America&#x2019;s original city upon a hill. As he concludes, Boston not only shaped our nation&#x2019;s urban past but also charted its metropolitan future.

Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn&#x2019;t rely on it, because it&#x2019;s not guaranteed and it&#x2019;s not permanent and it&#x2019;s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing&#x2014;the characters, the story, the words, the themes&#x2014;and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don&#x2019;t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don&#x2019;t fall apart.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You&#x2019;re a young author--is it your current adult perspective or not-so-recent teenage perspective that brought about the factions in the development of this story? Do you think that teens or adults are more likely to fit into categories in our current society?</p> <p><strong>Roth:</strong> Other aspects of my identity have more to do with the factions than my age. The faction system reflects my beliefs about human nature&#x2014;that we can make even something as well-intentioned as virtue into an idol, or an evil thing. And that virtue as an end unto itself is worthless to us. I did spend a large portion of my adolescence trying to be as &#x201c;good&#x201d; as possible so that I could prove my worth to the people around me, to myself, to God, to everyone. It&#x2019;s only now that I&#x2019;m a little older that I realize I am unable to be truly &#x201c;good&#x201d; and that it&#x2019;s my reasons for striving after virtue that need adjustment more than my behavior. In a sense, <em>Divergent</em> is me writing through that realization&#x2014;everyone in Beatrice&#x2019;s society believes that virtue is the end, the answer. I think that&#x2019;s a little twisted.</p> <p>I think we all secretly love and hate categories&#x2014;love to get a firm hold on our identities, but hate to be confined&#x2014;and I never loved and hated them more than when I was a teenager. That said: Though we hear a lot about high school cliques, I believe that adults categorize each other just as often, just in subtler ways. It is a dangerous tendency of ours. And it begins in adolescence.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> If you could add one more faction to the world within <em>Divergent</em>, what would it be?</p> <p><strong>Roth:</strong> I tried to construct the factions so that they spanned a wide range of virtues. Abnegation, for example, includes five of the traditional &#x201c;seven heavenly virtues:&#x201d; chastity, temperance, charity, patience, and humility. That said, it would be interesting to have a faction centered on industriousness, in which diligence and hard work are valued most, and laziness is not allowed. They would be in constant motion, and would probably be happy to take over for the factionless. And hard-working people can certainly take their work too far, as all the factions do with their respective virtues. I&#x2019;m not sure what they would wear, though. Overalls, probably.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think are the advantages, if any, to the society you&#x2019;ve created in <em>Divergent</em>?</p> <p><strong>Roth:</strong> All the advantages I see only seem like advantages to me because I live in our current society. For example, the members of their society don&#x2019;t focus on certain things: race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc. I mean, a world in which you look different from the majority and no one minds? That sounds good to me. But when I think about it more, I realize that they&#x2019;re doing the exact same thing we do, but with different criteria by which to distinguish ourselves from others. Instead of your skin color, it&#x2019;s the color of your shirt that people assess, or the results of your aptitude test. Same problem, different system.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What book are you currently reading and how has it changed you, if at all?</p> <p><strong>Roth:</strong> I recently finished <em>Imaginary Girls</em> by Nova Ren Suma, which I would call &#x201c;contemporary with a paranormal twist,&#x201d; or something to that effect. It&#x2019;s about a girl whose sister has a powerful kind of magnetism within the confines of a particular town, and how their love for each other breaks some things apart and puts other things back together. It was refreshing to read a young adult book that is about sisterhood instead of romance. It&#x2019;s one of those books that makes you love a character and then hate a character and then love them again&#x2014;that shows you that people aren&#x2019;t all good or all bad, but somewhere in between. <em>Imaginary Girls</em> gave me a lot to think about, and the writing was lovely, which I always love to see.</p> <p></p><p>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue&#x2014;Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is&#x2014;she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.</p><p>During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles to determine who her friends really are&#x2014;and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</p></p><h2>Knitting Ephemera: A Compendium of Articles, Useful and Otherwise, for the Edification and Amusement of the Handknitter</h2><p>Did you know that knitting burns 102 calories per hour?

Entertainment Inc. Harry Potter publishing rights � J. K. Rowling. (s05)</p></p><p>As his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry approaches, 15-year-old Harry Potter is in full-blown adolescence, complete with regular outbursts of rage, a nearly debilitating crush, and the blooming of a powerful sense of rebellion. It's been yet another infuriating and boring summer with the despicable Dursleys, this time with minimal contact from our hero's non-Muggle friends from school. Harry is feeling especially edgy at the lack of news from the magic world, wondering when the freshly revived evil Lord Voldemort will strike. Returning to Hogwarts will be a relief... or will it?<p> The fifth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard, who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. Somehow, over the summer, gossip (usually traced back to the magic world's newspaper, the <i>Daily Prophet</i>) has turned Harry's tragic and heroic encounter with Voldemort at the Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teen. Even Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of the school, has come under scrutiny by the Ministry of Magic, which refuses to officially acknowledge the terrifying truth that Voldemort is back. Enter a particularly loathsome new character: the toadlike and simpering ("<i>hem, hem</i>") Dolores Umbridge, senior undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, who takes over the vacant position of Defense Against Dark Arts teacher--and in no time manages to become the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, as well. Life isn't getting any easier for Harry Potter. With an overwhelming course load as the fifth years prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations (O.W.Ls), devastating changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team lineup, vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors, and increasing pain in his lightning-shaped scar, Harry's resilience is sorely tested.</p><p> <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i>, more than any of the four previous novels in the series, is a coming-of-age story. Harry faces the thorny transition into adulthood, when adult heroes are revealed to be fallible, and matters that seemed black-and-white suddenly come out in shades of gray. Gone is the wide-eyed innocent, the whiz kid of <i>Sorcerer's Stone</i>. Here we have an adolescent who's sometimes sullen, often confused (especially about girls), and always self-questioning. Confronting death again, as well as a startling prophecy, Harry ends his year at Hogwarts exhausted and pensive. Readers, on the other hand, will be energized as they enter yet again the long waiting period for the next title in the marvelous, magical series.

Now living and relaxing in the Minnesota woods, Quarry is lured out of retirement by a Chicago media magnate who wants a seemingly harmless young librarian dead. But when he winds up falling for his target, one Janet Wright, Quarry begins second-guessing his assignment and experiences an uncharacteristic change of heart that almost gets him killed. Stemming from Collins's screenplay for the award-winning short film <i>A Matter of Principal</i>, this novel covers a lot of ground in a small space&#x2014;a credit to the distinct, wry voice Collins has given Quarry, who doesn't waste anything, least of all words: "Louis cracked open the door and peered out and said, 'What is it?' and I shot him in the eye." Compact enough to be read in a couple of sittings but bristling with suspense and sexuality, this book is a welcome addition to the Hard Crime Case library and, if there's any justice, will spark sales of Collins's back-catalogue titles. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is wintertime, late December: a species of "now." A narrator&#x2015;Tsypkinis on a train going to Leningrad. And it is also mid-April 1867. The newly married Dostoyevskys, Fyodor, and his wife, Anna Grigor'yevna, are on their way to Germany, for a four-year trip. This is not, like J. M. Coetzee's <em>The Master of St. Petersburg</em>, a Dostoyevsky fantasy. Neither is it a docu-novel, although its author was obsessed with getting everything "right." Nothing is invented, everything is invented. Dostoyevsky's reckless passions for gambling, for his literary vocation, for his wife, are matched by her all-forgiving love, which in turn resonates with the love of literature's disciple, Leonid Tsypkin, for Dostoyevsky. In a remarkable introductory essay (which appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>), Susan Sontag explains why it is something of a miracle that <em>Summer in Baden-Baden</em> has survived, and celebrates the happy event of its publication in America with an account of Tsypkin's beleaguered life and the important pleasures of his marvelous novel.</p><p>Leonid Tsypkin was born in Minsk in 1926 of Russian-Jewish parents, both physicians. His last book, Summer in Baden-Baden, is the culmination of a passionate, clandestine literary vocation; a distinguished medical researcher by profession, Tsypkin never saw a page of his literary work published during his lifetime. The manuscript of Summer in Baden-Baden was smuggled out of the Soviet Union in 1981, and the novel was first published in a Russian-�migr� weekly in the United States. Tsypkin, who had been twice denied permission to leave the Soviet Union with his family, died of a heart attack in Moscow in 1982.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Before he Kills (A Mackenzie White Mystery-Book 1)</h2><p>From #1 bestselling author Blake Pierce comes a heart-pounding new mystery series. In the cornfields of Nebraska a woman is found murdered, strung up on a pole, the victim of a deranged killer. It doesn&#x2019;t take long for the police to realize a serial killer is on the loose&#x2014;and that his spree has just begun. Detective Mackenzie White, young, tough, smarter than the aging, chauvinistic men on her local force, finds herself called in grudgingly to help solve it. As much as the other officers hate to admit it, they need her young, brilliant mind, which has already helped crack cold cases that had left them stumped. Yet even for Mackenzie this new case proves an impossible riddle, something the likes of which she&#x2014;and the local force&#x2014;have ever seen. With the FBI called in, together, an intense manhunt ensues. Mackenzie, reeling from her own dark past, her failed relationships, and her undeniable attraction to the new FBI agent, finds herself battling her own demons as her hunt for the killer takes her to the darkest places of her mind. As she delves into the killer&#x2019;s mind, obsessing over his twisted psychology, she finds that evil truly does exist. She only hopes it will not be too late to extricate herself from it, as her entire life collapses around her. As more bodies turn up dead and a frantic race against time ensues, there is no way out but to find him before he kills again.

Operating under the code name "Johnny Walker," he risked his life on more than a thousand missions and became a legend in the U.S. special-ops community, many of whose members credit him with saving their lives.

Using his wits to outthink the insurgency, Johnny Walker unmasked countless terrorists and helped foil an untold number of plots against Americans and their allies.

Turned down, out of work, and desperate to feed his family, Johnny was on the verge of despair until one night he interceded in a dispute between some Iraqi women and Ameri-can MPs. Impressed, the MPs arranged to hire him as their interpreter, or "terp." Johnny displayed such talent and incredible courage under fire that several months later an elite unit of Navy SEALs took him under its wing. He quickly became the most sought-after terp in the country, receiving numerous citations and commendations for his work. Credited by SEAL sniper Chris Kyle with saving countless American lives, Johnny spent six years working with SEALs and other special operations forces throughout Iraq, completing more than one thousand missions. After narrowly escaping two attempts on his life, Johnny was helped to the United States by the SEALs in 2009. He and his family currently live in California, where he helps train special operations units.</p><br><br><p><strong>Jim DeFelice</strong>&nbsp;is the co-author, with former U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, of the multi-million-copy bestseller&nbsp;<em>American Sniper,&nbsp;</em>the source for Clint Eastwood&#x2019;s film starring Bradley Cooper<em>.&nbsp;</em>His other books include&nbsp;<em>Omar Bradley: General at War; Rangers at Dieppe;&nbsp;and West Like Lightning: The Brief, Legendary Ride of the Pony Express</em>.

And <i>Paddling the Everglades Wilderness Waterway</i> is the all-in-one guide for safe adventure on this spectacular 99-mile route. No time for such days-long expeditions? No matter. Authors Holly Genzen and Anne McCrary Sullivan entice with their favorite day- and overnight trips from various Everglades departure points. Having spent years exploring this maritime labyrinth, the authors now share their intimate knowledge of historic Everglades rivers and bays, the endless horizon of its Gulf Coast, the eerie beauty of its mangrove forests, and the secrets of ancient tribes and early-American pioneers who left their distinctive traces. Descriptions of wildlife abound (the birds! the alligators!), as do the details of exquisite flora that flourishes here. But Genzen and Sullivan do not skimp on practicalities nor on threats to this environment. Safety, weather, insects, food, fresh water, and camping on rustic "chickee" platforms stilted above the rivers all earn many pages here. As does what lies in store for the timeless but fragile Everglades ecology. This book is a treasure trove for all paddlers&#x2014;from novices to champions.</p><p></p><h2>Douglas MacArthur: What Greater Honor (Heroes of History)</h2><p>Under siege on the island of Corregidor, General Douglas MacArthur received a warning from the enemy.

Virtually closed to outsiders for centuries, by the early 1900s the rainforest of the Congo River basin was one of the most brutally exploited places on earth. In <i>Land of Tears</i>, historian Robert Harms reconstructs the chaotic process by which this happened. Beginning in the 1870s, traders, explorers, and empire builders from Arabia, Europe, and America moved rapidly into the region, where they pioneered a deadly trade in ivory and rubber for Western markets and in enslaved labor for the Indian Ocean rim. Imperial conquest followed close behind. <br>Ranging from remote African villages to European diplomatic meetings to Connecticut piano-key factories, <i>Land of Tears</i> reveals how equatorial Africa became fully, fatefully, and tragically enmeshed within our global world.<br></p><p><b>Robert Harms</b> is Henry J. Heinz Professor of History and African Studies at Yale University.

The band aimed to build on previous sales and critical acclaim with its boldest and most ambitious album yet, but was instead urged by skittish Reprise execs to make the record more &#x201c;radio friendly.&#x201d; When Wilco wouldn&#x2019;t give, they found themselves without a label. Instead, they used the Internet to introduce the album to their fans, and eventually sold the record to Nonesuch, another division of Warner. Wilco was vindicated when the album debuted at No. 13 on the <i>Billboard</i> charts and posted the band&#x2019;s strongest sales to date. <br><b><br></b><i>Wilco: Learning How to Die</i> traces the band&#x2019;s story to its deepest origins in Southern Illinois, where Jeff Tweedy began growing into one of the best songwriters of his generation. As we witness how his music grew from its punk and alt-country origins, some of the key issues and questions in our culture are addressed: How is music of substance created while the gulf between art and commerce widens in the corporate consolidation era? How does the music industry make or break a hit? How do working musicians reconcile the rewards of artistic risk with the toll it exacts on their personal life? <br><br>This book was written with the cooperation of Wilco band members past and present.&nbsp; It is also fully up to date, covering the latest changes in personnel and the imminent release of the band&#x2019;s fifth album, <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>, sure to be one of the most talked-about albums of 2004.</p></p><p><p>An award-winning music critic for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, <b>GREG KOT</b> contributes to a wide array of national magazines, including <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and co-hosts the rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll talk show <i>Sound Opinions</i> on radio and television, and at www.soundopinions.net.<b><br></b></p>Chapter 1<br><br>&#x201c;You Have To Learn How To Die&#x201d;<br><br>Jeff Tweedy was sobbing as he sang. He and his bandmates in Wilco were coming off a grueling tour that had seen them play too many shows too far from home for far too long, and now they had just finished up four days of recording sessions in an Austin, Texas, studio. Listening to the playback, Tweedy could measure the toll. He could hear the depression and exhaustion in his voice, the misgivings about the life he had made for himself. Music was both the best thing that had ever happened to him and the worst. It kept him away from his wife and family for long stretches, and now he was beginning to doubt everything: his music, his marriage, the sound of his own voice. The songs held no answers; they simply channeled what was in his heart and mind. Both, frankly, had seen better, brighter days. &#x201c;I dreamed about killing you again last night, and it felt alright to me.&#x201d; He heard himself sing the words as they marched past him; rather than cushioning or muffling the lyrics, the music seemed to highlight them, making them even more difficult to bear. All Jeff Tweedy could think was, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve failed. I&#x2019;ve let the band down. I sound like the most depressed person in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>But he hadn&#x2019;t failed. He had taken the first blind leap into an album that would prove to be one of the defining moments of his and Wilco&#x2019;s career. <i>Summerteeth</i> would expose his inner world to an almost unbearable degree but, with the help of his bandmates, somehow turn it into life-affirming music.<br><br>A couple of years later, Tweedy would write a song called &#x201c;War on War,&#x201d; in which he would sing, &#x201c;You have to learn how to die, if you wanna wanna be alive.&#x201d;<br><br>In that Austin recording studio, Tweedy died a little. It was a feeling he already knew intimately. There was the moment Jay Farrar took the band they had built together, Uncle Tupelo, and tore it apart by telling Jeff Tweedy he couldn&#x2019;t stand working with him anymore. The moment Tweedy turned an alternative-country concert for a club full of Johnny Cash fans into a punk-rock kamikaze mission. The night Tweedy baited a British audience until they wanted to tear his fool Yankee head off. And still to come would be the moment when he found his record label didn&#x2019;t want the best record he&#x2019;d ever made.<br><br>Beneath the facade of the small-town newspaper-delivery boy that he once was, the kid who wouldn&#x2019;t speak unless he was spoken to, Jeff Tweedy brings a self-confidence that cannot be ignored or denied. It can be willful and sometimes almost cruel, but it is not indiscriminate or random. The personality can best be glimpsed and assessed through the music, because Tweedy is a songwriter of knee-buckling honesty. The emotions in his songs examine the heart of darkness that, to some degree, lurks in all of us. His great subject is intimacy&#x2014;with a lover, with a friend, with music itself&#x2014;and its price. His songs teeter between bliss and oblivion: &#x201c;There is something wrong with me&#x201d;; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got reservations about so many things, but not about you&#x201d;; &#x201c;I am trying to break your heart&#x201d;; &#x201c;Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned.&#x201d;<br><br>He can ice the listener&#x2019;s blood with a scream; there are nights when &#x201c;Misunderstood&#x201d; sounds like a back-alley mugging, when his howl &#x201c;I want to thank you all for nothin&#x2019;, nothin&#x2019; at all&#x201d; repeats until the veins rise like blue fault lines down his neck. Or he can cut our hearts out with a whisper. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a Jar&#x201d; climaxes with a line that lands with a sickening thud, a corpse being dropped from a third-floor window, but it&#x2019;s sung with the understatement of an undertaker: &#x201c;She begs me not to hit her.&#x201d; Left unanswered is precisely what kind of holocaust the character in this song had to live through to deliver that line with such matter-of-factness. Not knowing is almost a relief.<br><br>In the way they marry the everyday with the surreal, the opaque with the anthemic, the acerbic with the melodic, Tweedy&#x2019;s songs evoke the work of the great songwriters, not so much the usual suspects (Neil Young, Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan) as the lost punks, iconoclasts, and misfits who put the color in Tweedy&#x2019;s life between the headphones. Tweedy learned to be a great listener before he became a great songwriter and musician, and he developed a connoisseur&#x2019;s taste: Pere Ubu&#x2019;s Peter Laughner, the Minutemen&#x2019;s D. Boon, the English folkies Nick Drake and Bill Fay. With these rock outsiders Tweedy shares a certain daring, a way of looking at the world that demands more of it and more of himself, sometimes at a steep cost. Tweedy&#x2019;s cry &#x201c;Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm&#x201d; on <i>Summerteeth</i> echoes the desperation of Nick Drake as he sang in the darkness of a British recording studio just weeks before entering a psychiatric rest home, murmuring about the world&#x2019;s fading beauty, even though unable to lift his face off the studio floor.<br><br>With each Wilco album&#x2014;including two <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> collaborations with Billy Bragg on the lyrics of Woody Guthrie&#x2014;Tweedy and his band have pushed their music to measure up against those lost giants. They&#x2019;ve done what few bands in the post-Nirvana rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll world have managed: to better themselves with each album. It&#x2019;s not a stretch to imagine Dylan and the Band bashing out a Tweedy song such as &#x201c;Dreamer in My Dreams&#x201d; in the basement of Big Pink. And it&#x2019;s possible to get so lost in the closing moments of Wilco&#x2019;s ensemble performances in &#x201c;Reservations&#x201d; or &#x201c;One by One&#x201d; that time melts away.<br><br>&#x201c;Jeff is one of the few people I am envious of as a writer,&#x201d; says Gary Louris, whose band the Jayhawks helped restore the art of songwriting to 1990s rock. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to be a curmudgeon, but there&#x2019;s very little that impresses me when I listen to new stuff. Whether it&#x2019;s the White Stripes or whoever the band of the moment is supposed to be, I think, &#x2018;That&#x2019;s kinda cool, but compare it to the greatest stuff in rock and it pales.&#x2019; I try to look at things like that in perspective, stacked against the best of all time, and I think Jeff ranks up there. You can put his stuff against anyone&#x2019;s, and as a songwriter he doesn&#x2019;t have to back down to anyone. He lives the music, more than anyone I know. He&#x2019;s immersed in music, and it shows.&#x201d;<br><br>R.E.M.&#x2019;s Peter Buck simply calls Tweedy &#x201c;one of the best songwriters of his generation.&#x201d;<br><br>It took time. For a shy small-town kid from the Midwest, to risk failure in the name of artistic expression is to contradict a lifetime&#x2019;s worth of social schooling. But the thirty-four-year-old man who wrote &#x201c;War on War&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t that far removed from the fourth grader who brandished a cassette copy of Bruce Springsteen&#x2019;s <i>Born to Run</i> one day at school and informed his classmates that it was his creation. It was as if the kid weren&#x2019;t challenging his classmates to believe so much as himself.<br><br>With his high-school friend Jay Farrar in Uncle Tupelo, Tweedy forged a style of music that both embodied and repudiated the small-town life he had known in Belleville, Illinois, a blue-collar town surrounded by farms and strip mines thirty miles southeast of St. Louis. Together they steered the band with a tight-lipped refusal to pander, a deft songwriting touch, and voices that sounded like they could&#x2019;ve fit comfortably alongside the plainspoken misfits on Harry Smith&#x2019;s <i>Anthology of American Folk Music</i>. But whereas Farrar was already a fully formed musical talent at the time of Uncle Tupelo&#x2019;s first album, Tweedy grew into a formidable songwriter incrementally. On Uncle Tupelo&#x2019;s fourth album, <i>Anodyne</i>, in 1993, he was finally sharing the songwriting load equally with Farrar, matching him song for quality song. Uncle Tupelo&#x2019;s twang punk sowed seeds for an alternative-country movement that would become a fad by 1995, spawning a spate of major-label signings of Tupelo-like bands, a still-thriving Internet community of fans, and the fanzine <i>No Depression</i>, named after the Carter Family song that had provided the title for Uncle Tupelo&#x2019;s 1990 debut album. But Uncle Tupelo wasn&#x2019;t around to enjoy the spoils. The band&#x2019;s bitter breakup would prove a watershed in Tweedy&#x2019;s development as an artist: within months he took the remaining members of Uncle Tupelo into the studio and began shaping a musical personality that would take him far beyond the alt-country world that he and Farrar had been credited with creating.<br><br>It was no accident that Tweedy&#x2019;s abilities as a songwriter and arranger caught up to his ambitions in Wilco; by the time Uncle Tupelo broke up, John Stirratt and Ken Coomer had begun to evolve into a swinging rhythm section, and the versatility of the musicians added and subtracted along the way&#x2014;Max Johnston, Jay Bennett, Bob Egan, Leroy Bach, Glenn Kotche, Mikael Jorgensen&#x2014;paved new avenues for Tweedy&#x2019;s songs. In its raunchiest moments, Wilco celebrated rock for rocking&#x2019;s sake: the Keith Richards&#x2013;worthy riff high-stepping out of &#x201c;Casino Queen,&#x201d; the fractured guitar solo in &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the Man Who Loves You,&#x201d; the Velvet Underground&#x2013;worthy throb of &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Always in Love.&#x201d; The band mastered the simple joy and immediacy of a pop song, in the spacious arms-wide-open wonder of &#x201c;California Stars,&#x201d; or the sing-along that drunkenly smiles at crushing small-town routine in &#x201c;Passenger Side.&#x201d; What&#x2019;s most intriguing, however, is a more recent development: Wilco&#x2019;s increasing aptitude for exploring the shadows. On their 2002 album, <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>, they make music that evokes the feeling of being between worlds, of searching for consolation on a planet that feels lonelier than ever even as it becomes more packed with distractions, information, and convenience stores. It&#x2019;s all there in &#x201c;Ashes of American Flags,&#x201d; the sound of 3 a.m. solitude, of Miles Davis&#x2019;s &#x201c;Blue in Green&#x201d; or the Flamingos&#x2019; &#x201c;I Only Have Eyes for You,&#x201d; music so intimate it&#x2019;s like a whisper in the listener&#x2019;s ear.<br><br>At its best, the music industry was complicit in such exchanges, a conduit between the most profound musicians of an era and the most ravenous music fans. When Wilco signed to Reprise Records in 1994 and became part of the Warner Brothers empire, it was joining a group of labels with a long, rich history of supporting not just musical giants such as Frank Sinatra, Neil Young, and R.E.M. but mavericks such as Van Dyke Parks, Ry Cooder, and Randy Newman. It was an artist-driven label run by music aficionados, and Wilco fit right in with the philosophy: to sign artists with a genuine vision that would be developed over a dozen albums, rather than quick-hit wonders designed to cash in on a trend. Then it all went wrong.<br><br>It was Wilco&#x2019;s lot to develop into a creative force at a time when the monetary value of music soared to an all-time high even as its artistic worth plummeted lower than Christina Aguilera&#x2019;s leather hip-huggers.<br><br>Against the backdrop of a $156 billion merger between America Online and Time Warner in 2000, bands such as Wilco&#x2014;whose entire catalog for the conglomerate had sold about 1.5 million copies&#x2014;became expendable. At least that&#x2019;s what two Reprise executives believed in the spring of 2001, when they decided to take a pass on Wilco&#x2019;s fourth album, <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>.<br><br>It was a signpost of a trend that impinged on all the arts, especially music: For the last decade, the intelligence of America&#x2019;s listening audience had been tacitly ridiculed by the multinational corporations that make, market, and filter most of the music we hear. A band&#x2019;s worth was determined no longer by its artistic reach, its potential to create music of lasting significance, but by how rapidly it could find a huge audience. It didn&#x2019;t matter whether that audience was seduced by a designer fashion line, an acting role in a Hollywood movie, a tie-in with a video game, or, perchance, a compact disc as long as the corporate shareholders got their quarterly dose of good news. Of the Big Five corporations that ran the music industry at the time of the AOL&#x2013;Time Warner merger, none was in it exclusively for the music; they had spread their financial claims across a diverse range of products, from cell phones to wine coolers, and music was just another widget on the assembly line.<br><br>The trend toward simpler music, quicker success, and more instantly marketable artists presumed that America had become a nation of indifferent, inattentive listeners and it should get the music it deserved. In turn, the multinationals poured big bucks into manufacturing pop stars, even those who couldn&#x2019;t sing or play a lick. Of course, prefab pop was at least as old as the Monkees and Menudo, but now the stakes were higher than ever: $14 million alone to make sure that everyone knew that Jennifer Lopez had a new album of pitch-corrected pop songs on the market. That left little or no cash to promote &#x201c;difficult&#x201d; artists, who were seen as self-indulgent prima donnas who could not be easily molded into multimillion sellers.<br><br>&#x201c;Jeff Tweedy is a twat,&#x201d; one former major-label president told me at the height of the singer&#x2019;s travails with Reprise. Though acknowledging the enduring merit of Wilco&#x2019;s music, the executive&#x2014;who didn&#x2019;t even work for Warner Brothers&#x2014;marveled at Wilco&#x2019;s desire to make &#x201c;indulgent albums&#x201d; for what had become the music industry&#x2019;s largest corporation. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s unacceptable at this time for any artist to behave the way he does. Who does he think he is? Neil Young?&#x201d;<br><br>Perhaps. Neil Young once got sued by his label in the 1980s for making what the gravely disappointed executive David Geffen called &#x201c;unrepresentative&#x201d; albums&#x2014;in other words, they didn&#x2019;t sell well enough. Two decades later, the stakes for Wilco and Reprise were even higher. The business of making music generates more than $12 billion a year, more annual revenue than even the movie industry. Yet as teen consumers are being tempted by diversions other than CDs&#x2014;DVDs, cable TV, home video games, and, most insidious of all, personal computers&#x2014;the Big Five, and the newly bloated AOL Time Warner in particular, are on a mission to cut not just the nonprofitable acts but even some of the ones who aren&#x2019;t profitable enough.<br><br>Into the latter camp fell Wilco. Wilco&#x2019;s sin wasn&#x2019;t that it was a drain on Time Warner&#x2019;s budget; here was a band, after all, that was pulling down more than $1 million a year on tour and therefore required no handouts from the label to stay on the road. But it simply wasn&#x2019;t big enough soon enough to suit the new demands of a business looking for instant megastars and cross-promotional celebrities. In the year after the merger was announced, AOL Time Warner&#x2019;s value had sagged by more than $50 billion. At a time when the blockbuster hit mattered more than ever, anything less&#x2014;even a band emerging as one of the most important American rock bands of the last ten years&#x2014;was deadweight.<br><br>So for music lovers who were paying attention to these dispiriting machinations, it was not particularly startling when Reprise rejected <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> in July 2001. The real surprise came next. Rather than water down the music to meet its record company&#x2019;s demands for a more commercial album containing more radio-friendly songs, the band left Reprise, began streaming Foxtrot on its Web site&#x2014;essentially giving its music away&#x2014;and performed its new songs on a national tour.<br><br>The Chicago quintet&#x2019;s industry end around was a risky move that turned into an artistic and commercial coup. When <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> was finally released nine months later on Nonesuch Records (ironically, another, albeit smaller, subsidiary of the same AOL Time Warner conglomerate to which Reprise belongs), it was already one of the year&#x2019;s most widely discussed albums, a cause c�l�bre in the media, and a major embarrassment for the once-venerated Reprise, which underwent a leadership overhaul in the wake of Wilco&#x2019;s departure. <i>Foxtrot</i> sold more than 55,000 copies in its first week an...</p><h2>Our Sacred Ma�z Is Our Mother: Indigeneity and Belonging in the Americas</h2><p>&#x201c;If you want to know who you are and where you come from, follow the ma�z.&#x201d; That was the advice given to author Roberto Cintli Rodriguez when he was investigating the origins and migrations of Mexican peoples in the Four Corners region of the United States.<br><br> Follow it he did, and his book <i>Our Sacred Ma�z Is Our Mother</i> changes the way we look at Mexican Americans. Not so much peoples created as a result of war or invasion, they are people of the corn, connected through a seven-thousand-year old ma�z culture to other Indigenous inhabitants of the continent. Using corn as the framework for discussing broader issues of knowledge production and history of belonging, the author looks at how corn was included in codices and Mayan texts, how it was discussed by elders, and how it is represented in theater and stories as a way of illustrating that Mexicans and Mexican Americans share a common culture.<br><br> Rodriguez brings together scholarly and traditional (elder) knowledge about the long history of ma�z/corn cultivation and culture, its roots in Mesoamerica, and its living relationship to Indigenous peoples throughout the continent, including Mexicans and Central Americans now living in the United States. The author argues that, given the restrictive immigration policies and popular resentment toward migrants, a continued connection to ma�z culture challenges the social exclusion and discrimination that frames migrants as outsiders and gives them a sense of belonging not encapsulated in the idea of citizenship.

I am certain your work will be well received by a wide audience. Your book is well written. <br><br> Sincerely, <br><br>Lisa Conner<br>Manuscript Review Team<br>Outskirts Press, Inc.From The Introduction<br><br>Toxic chemicals have reigned over the pesticide industry for more than a half-century with their products dominating retail shelves, in homes and literally everywhere, amounting to a multi-billion dollar a year industry for the chemical manufacturers. It's interesting to note that more than $1 billion per year is spent on just fleas and ticks alone, and still people complain these products do not work as bugs develop resistance to them.<br><br> Who can use this book? This practical guide for using Diatomaceous Earth (DE) is not only for consumers but also for health practitioners who prefer to guide their clients to focus on natural least-toxic alternatives to chemical pesticides. These how-to tips benefit a broad cross-section of the community: the unborn fetus, children, pregnant and lactating women, home owners, gardeners, pet owners, bird keepers; animal breeders; boarding kennel operators; veterinarians, and farmers. DE is used for cows, horses, alpachas, goats, pigs, sheep, poultry, ostriches, crops and orchards, granary and storage operators for nuts, grains, seeds, legumes, grain growers, pest control operators for schools, playgrounds parks, city and county public facilities including sewers, medical and food handling facilities, warehouses, factories, retirement and convalescent homes, hotels, and agricultural fairs.<br><br>Over 90 percent of American households use toxic synthetic chemical pesticides and household products. However, rising current public concern about the hazards of toxic chemicals is creating a healthy response. Increasingly larger numbers of consumers are waking up to the realization that blind faith in routine pesticide exposure and treatments is no longer healthy or acceptable--mistakenly, it was once considered the norm.<br><br>Alarmed consumers have become more aware and educated about the consequences of what harmful toxic chemical insecticides can do when absorbed through the skin, or inhaled, or ingested after contaminating carpets, floors, pet bedding, children's clothing, and areas used for playing, eating or sleeping, as well as our food supply and water. As a result, consumers have developed a healthier attitude, a new surge of interest and a steadily increasing demand for safer and non-toxic alternative solutions to replace harmful insecticides such as Diatomaceous Earth.</p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Aphrodisiacs: Psychoactive Substances for Use in Sexual Practices</h2><p>The most comprehensive guide to the botany, pharmacology, cultural, ritual, and personal use of erotically stimulating substances from antiquity to the present day <br> <br>� Details the use, preparation, and dosage of more than 400 plant, animal, mineral, and synthetic substances, both common and exotic, as well as their botany, science, and legal status <br> <br>� Explores the historical and present use of aphrodisiacs and their role in sexual practices, culture, and art <br> <br>� Richly illustrated throughout with more than 800 color photographs <br> <br>The culmination of more than 30 years of cultural, anthropological, and scientific research, this encyclopedia examines the botany, pharmacology, history, preparation, dosage, and practical use of more than 400 erotically stimulating substances from antiquity to the present day. <br> <br>From plants and animals that enhance fertility and virility, like celery, snails, or oysters, to substances that induce arousal, like ephedra, opium, or cannabis, the encyclopedia is richly illustrated with more than 800 color photographs--many of which are from the authors&#x2019; extensive fieldwork around the world.

As controversial as he was influential, his critics have named a judgmental and joyless attitude after him, while his admirers celebrate him as the principal theologian of Reformed Christianity. Yet his impact is unmistakable-a primary developer of western civilization whose life and work have deeply affected five centuries' worth of pastors, scholars, and individuals.</p><p>What will surprise the readers of this book, however, is that Calvin did not live primarily to influence future generations. Rather, he considered himself first and foremost a spiritual pilgrim and a minister of the Word in the church of his day. It was from that "essential" Calvin that all his influence flowed.</p><p>Here is an introduction to Calvin's life and thought and essence: a man who moved people not through the power of personality but through passion for the Word, a man who sought to serve the gospel in the most humble of roles.</p></p><p><p><strong>W. Robert Godfrey</strong> (PhD, Stanford University) serves as the president and professor of church history at Westminster Seminary California. Godfrey is a minister in the United Reformed Churches and the author of numerous articles and books.</p><p>President and Professor of Church History, Westminster Seminary California</p><p>"This book is a masterful treatment of John Calvin by a masterful church historian. We see Calvin the theologian, Calvin the reformer, Calvin the man. His mind and heart are laid bare by Dr. Godfrey's work. A must read."<br>&#x2015;<strong>R. C. Sproul,</strong> Founder, Ligonier Ministries</p><p>"John Calvin: Pilgrim and Pastor will surely rank among the best introductions to the life and thought of one of the church's greatest theologians. It offers a rich tapestry woven from both Calvin's life-story and his profound biblical theology. Here we meet the real Calvin-strikingly apostolic in his constant preaching, his lecturing, his authorship of many erudite volumes and a vast correspondence, and his deep care for the many needs of his flock-while himself in constant physical sickness. It is a remarkable story. Dr. Robert Godfrey's mature scholarship, enthusiasm for his subject, and easy style bring Calvin to life for the twenty-first-century reader. Here is a rare work indeed, making it easy to see why the great Genevan Reformer was such an inspiration to those who knew and loved him."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Sinclair B. Ferguson,</strong> Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor of Systematic Theology, Reformed Theological Seminary; Teaching Fellow, Ligonier Ministries</p><p>"There are good books on Calvin's doctrine, his life, his piety, and his influence in the modern world. However, this book stands out as a marvelous integration of all three. More than accessible, this book is interesting even for those who know nothing about Calvin or his significant labors. It would be dishonest to deny that this book is written by an admirer of Calvin, but as a veteran church historian, Professor Godfrey places the reformer in his context and does not hide his blemishes. I owe a great deal of my own formative understanding of Calvin to Robert Godfrey and hope for a wide readership of this important book."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Horton,</strong> J. Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California</p><p>"Bob Godfrey has long been known as doing the unimaginable and has once again lived up to his reputation. His work on Calvin offers not only an accessible history of the man and his work, and an assessment of his influence, but also allows Calvin to be seen through his own words and offers an opportunity for another generation to appreciate the vastness of his genius. Combining excellent scholarship with an accessible style, Dr. Godfrey has once again placed the church in his debt as he resurrects the character from the caricature in which Calvin is so often buried."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Robert M. Norris,</strong> Pastor, Fourth Presbyterian Church, Bethesda, Maryland</p><p>"This book is arguably the best introduction to the life and ministry of John Calvin by one of the Reformed world's best interpreters of the Reformation.

Dr. Krieger shows you how to detect when a person is sick, pinpoint where the pain is, and stimulate the recuperative powers of the sick person. With accurate descriptions of the changes that take place in body temperature, levels of consciousness, and physiology during this intense interaction, this book helps you interpret your healing experience and get the most meaning from it. <br> <i>The Therapeutic Touch</i> recaptures a simple, ancient mode of healing and shows how you can now become on integral part of your own or someone else's healing process.</p><p>In the early 1970s, registered nurse Dolores Krieger knew intuitively that she and her fellow nurses could do more to ease pain and accelerate healing. Out of this real-world inspiration, Krieger helped develop "Therapeutic Touch": a non-invasive technique that uses the flow of energy through the palms of the hands to soothe and heal. Dr. Krieger's landmark book on the subject, Therapeutic Touch: How to Use Your Hands to Help or to Heal (Prentice-Hall, 1979) is currently in its 37th reprinting.<p>On Therapeutic Touch, Dr. Krieger brings easy-to-learn techniques directly to the hands of every interested listener, helping them to free their natural healing power and apply it to everyone they touch. Using a photo-illustrated study guide accompanying the tape course, listeners learn practical methods for reducing pain, supporting the body's natural healing processes, boosting immune response, and invoking deep relaxation. Today, Therapeutic Touch is practiced in more than 100 U.S. hospitals and clinics and taught in 75 countries. Now Dr. Krieger's eagerly awaited Therapeutic Touch audio presentation offers professional and lay healers worldwide a rare opportunity to receive original teachings from this renowned and celebrated authority.</p><b>Dolores Krieger, PhD, RN,</b>&nbsp;a professor of nursing at New York University, is noted for her study and development of therapeutic touch and has been explaining her healing techniques on radio and television throughout the country, in workshops, and in many published articles.</p><h2>Mystery Of Iniquity</h2><p>The Mystery of Iniquity discloses the key event that will begin the last seven&#x2013;year countdown to Armageddon and the physical act that will reveal the Antichrist and constitute the final abomination of desolation.</p><p>Michael Rood is an author, historian, teacher, broadcaster, and life&#x2013;long student of the Bible.

Wool explores how the American soldiers most severely injured in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars struggle to build some kind of ordinary life while recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center from grievous injuries like lost limbs and traumatic brain injury. Between 2007 and 2008, Wool spent time with many of these mostly male soldiers and their families and loved ones in an effort to understand what it's like to be blown up and then pulled toward an ideal and ordinary civilian life in a place where the possibilities of such a life are called into question. Contextualizing these soldiers within a broader political and moral framework, Wool considers the soldier body as a historically, politically, and morally laden national icon of normative masculinity. She shows how injury, disability, and the reality of soldiers' experiences and lives unsettle this icon and disrupt the all-too-common narrative of the heroic wounded veteran as the embodiment of patriotic self-sacrifice. For these soldiers, the uncanny ordinariness of seemingly extraordinary everyday circumstances and practices at Walter Reed create a reality that will never be normal.&nbsp;</p><p>Zo� H.

Scientists worry that it's bad science (merely creationism in disguise) and theologians worry that it's bad theology (misunderstanding divine action). In this book William Dembski addresses these concerns and brilliantly argues that intelligent design provides a crucial link between science and theology. Various chapters creatively and powerfully address intelligent discernment of divine action in nature, why the significane of miracles should be reconsidered, and the demise and unanswered questions of British natural theology. Effectively challenging the hegemony of naturalism and reinstating design within science, Dembski shows how intelligent design can be unpacked as a theory of information. <em>Intelligent Design</em> is a pivotal, synthesizing work from a thinker whom Phillip Johnson calls "one of the most important of the design theorists who are sparking a scientific revolution by legitimating the concept of intelligent design in science."</p><p>"Einstein once remarked that the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible." This statement, quoted by William Dembski, is a way of summarizing intelligent design theory, which argues that it is possible to find evidence for design in the universe. The author of <i>The Design Inference</i> (a scholarly exploration of this topic published by Cambridge University Press) in this book aims to show the lay reader "how detecting design within the universe, and especially against the backdrop of biology and biochemistry, unseats naturalism"--and above all Darwin's expulsion of design in his theory of evolution. <p> <i>Intelligent Design</i> is organized into three parts: the first part gives an introduction to design and shows how modernity--science in the last two centuries--has undermined our intuition of this truth. The second and central part of the book examines "the philosophical and scientific basis for intelligent design." The final part shows how "science and theology relate coherently and how intelligent design establishes the crucial link between the two." This suggests that Dembski is not simply rejecting Darwin and naturalism on fundamentalist or biblical grounds. While grounded in faith, he wishes to show how "God's design is accessible to scientific inquiry." As such, the book should be of interest to all thinking believers. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>William Dembski (Ph.D., mathematics, University of Chicago; Ph.D., philosophy, University of Illinois at Chicago) is senior fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture.

The Other City is a guidebook to this invisible, "other Prague," overlapping the workaday world: a place where libraries can turn into jungles, secret passages yawn beneath our feet, and waves lap at our bedspreads. Heir to the tradition and obsessions of Jorge Luis Borges, as well as the long and distinguished line of Czech fantasists, Ajvaz's Other City--his first novel to be translated into English--is the emblem of all the worlds we are blind to, being caught in our own ways of seeing.</p></p><p>Michal Ajvaz is a Czech novelist, essayist, poet, and translator. In 2005, he was awarded the Jaroslav Seifert Prize for his novel Pra?zdne? ulice (Empty Streets). He is a researcher at Prague&#39;s Center for Theoretical Studies. In addition to fiction, he has published an essay on Derrida, a book-length meditation on Borges, and a philosophical study on the act of seeing.In Ajvaz's first novel to be translated into English, a Borgesian cohort of freakish creatures, talking birds and eccentric city dwellers lurk on the margins of an alternative Prague. An unnamed protagonist learns that a book written in an unearthly language is an opening to a dangerous world that is just around the corner from normal life. More and more frequently, the protagonist stumbles across scenes from the other city&#x2014;he spies on an inscrutable religious service, is treated to a lecture on the subject of Latest Discoveries about the Great Battle in the Bedrooms. The city's inhabitants do not take kindly to his intrusions; he is pursued by weasels, shot at by a helicopter and nearly eaten by a half-man, half-shark. Meanwhile, overheard conversations dissolve into nonsense, elk are stabled inside statues and birds recite passages from an epic poem. Ajvaz's novel is a gorgeous <i>matryoshka</i> doll of unreason, enigma and nonsense&#x2014;truly weird and compelling. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When she grew up, she moved to New York City, a place full of new wonders for her to explore. It was there she realized that, just like in nature, a city is an ecosystem. &#34;It is made of different parts --- sidewalks, parks, stores, neighborhoods, City Hall . . . and people, of course. When they all work together, the city is healthy.&#34; So, when city planner Robert Moses proposed creating highways through the city that would destroy neighborhoods and much of what made New York great, Jane decided she couldn&#39;t let it happen. She stood up to the officials and rallied her neighbors to stop the plans ---and even got arrested! Jane&#39;s bravery and ideas had a huge influence on urban planning that is still being felt today. In this lively and engaging informational picture book, award-winning author Susan Hughes provides a fictionalized story of the life of Jane Jacobs, one of the world&#39;s greatest urban thinkers and activists. This book makes a terrific resource for studying civic engagement, urban life, the history of New York and Toronto (where Jane moved later in life), and the role of city planning. Jane&#39;s inspirational story is also an excellent example for character education lessons on perseverance, citizenship and initiative. Stylized illustrations by Val�rie Boivin perfectly evoke the story&#39;s time and place.

She lives in Quebec City.</p>Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;New Yorkers should know and revere the name of Jane Jacobs, the city's own David, who fought and won against construction Goliath Robert Moses. Jacobs is best remembered in New York for her successful preservation of Washington Square Park in her beloved Greenwich Village neighborhood. This fictionalized picture book biography portrays Jacobs's life as an imaginative child, as well as a dedicated citizen who championed communities and parks over highways and commerce. Boivin's art brings the subject's world to life and excels at portraying the expressiveness and vivacity of Jacobs over the many years. Unfortunately, narrative and content choices limit the strength of this work. The book begins with Jacobs on a stroll alongside historic leaders, blurring the line between fiction and biography. Also, depicting her refusal to brush her teeth as a child is a puzzling choice to portray the basis of her future resistance.

Each image in <em>Talking Pictures</em> reveals a singular, frozen moment in a person&#x2019;s life, be it joyful, quiet, or steeped in sorrow. Yet the book&#x2019;s unique depth comes from the writing accompanying each photo: as with the caption revealing how one seemingly random snapshot of a dancing couple captured the first dance of their 40-year marriage, each successive inscription shines like a flashbulb illuminating a photograph&#x2019;s particular context and lighting up our connection to the past.</p><p>Ransom Riggs is the New York Times bestselling author of Miss Peregrine&#39;s Home for Peculiar Children, the writing of which was largely responsible for his current addiction to old photo collecting.

Roger finds some ancient stones on the grounds, which magically transport him back and forth in time so he can meet and befriend Toby, Linnet, Susan, and Tolly--the future inhabitants of Green Knowe and the heroes of the five other magical books in the series.</p><p><b>LUCY MARIA BOSTON</b> (1892-1990) purchased a ramshackle manor house near Cambridge, England, in 1935, which over a period of two years she lovingly restored. That house inspired her, at the age of sixty-two, to take pen in hand to create the beloved Green Knowe series.<br>For almost a year already Roger had watched the thick stone walls of the new house going up. All the time he was impatient and excited because he knew that it was going to be a marvel, it had been talked of for so long. So far, except for its tremendous solidity, it was not so very different from their old Saxon hall. It had arrow slits for windows and two rows of wooden pillars down the middle which would support the upper floor. It had no door. If he climbed up the builders' ladder outside and down inside, it felt like being in a prison, or perhaps in a very safe place. It depended on what game Roger was playing. He had never seen a stone house, and this one was to have two floors, an upstairs and a down. What could be grander? They would live on the upper floor, and the entrance door would be up there, up a flight of outside stairs. The ground floor would be for storage only. It was hard to imagine. All the houses in the village were either timber or wattle-and-daub. The hall his family had lived in till now was log-built, solid and dark and smoky. Its walls and rafters were painted in bright colors, but the smoke from the fire in the center of the floor blackened them as it curled its way up to the hole in the roof which served as a chimney. If, on a bitterly cold day sitting on the river bank with his fishing line, Roger thought of the great comfort of being back again in the house, the smell of wood smoke, and food, and people, and wet dogs, and straw and stable (for the four white oxen and the best horses had their stalls in with the family), came to mind as the coziest thing imaginable.<br><br> The Saxon hall was the center of the manor estate which Roger's father, Osmund d'Aulneaux, held under the Norman earl, whose daughter, the lady Eleanor, he had married. Originally the hall stood on a piece of ground half enclosed by a small backwater of the river. In the troubled time when King William Rufus died, Osmund had had the watercourse deepened and widened into a moat, cut off from the river and palisaded on the inner side. In case of attack the villagers and all the cattle could take refuge inside.<br><br> "No sensible man," Osmund said, "expects peace to last. But I hope this new house will. The church was built by the earl as a thanksgiving for the return of his son from the Crusade. What will our Bernard think when he comes back safe and sound from the fighting and finds his mother living in a fine stone manor house ready to welcome him?"<br><br> He said this to comfort his wife. Bernard, their eldest son, had gone as a page to the earl's brother who still lived in Normandy. There had been much fighting there, and no news had come from him for six months. His mother thought of him day and night. He had been sent away to the earl's household when he was only eight. It was the usual practice for the eldest son to be brought up by more important relations both to give him a better position and to bind the families together, but the lady Eleanor had never got over the parting. No other son could make up to her for her first-born. She was stern with her two daughters, and they took it out of Roger whenever they had the chance. The pages of the house were older than he. They spent their free time joking with the girls, playing such games as Blind Man's Buff that gave a chance of cuddling, or just making silly jokes, so Roger was rather left out. His grandmother was the one who loved him most. She was Osmund's mother, a Saxon of high birth. She lived in what was now her son's house, but it had been hers all her married life. Her Norman daughter-in-law, the lady Eleanor, looked down on her as a mere Saxon. This was always noticeable, because though the old lady had learned to speak French from her girlhood when she was given in marriage to a Norman, she never spoke it like a Norman-born. She loved her son, and after him all her affection was for Roger. She told him the old Saxon legends and stories, in which often the Normans were the enemies and did not always get the best of it, and she told them in her native English which best suited their racy style. This had to be confidential between her and Roger, as the lady Eleanor did not approve. In Norman families French was the proper language. English was for the natives, the lower orders. But the grandmother too was proud of her birth, and she loved her native land as a conqueror never could. She taught Roger that he had famous Saxon ancestors and that love of this particular place ran in his blood. Roger was the second son, eleven years old, just at the age to be most interested in the builders and their work. There is no stone in the fenlands, so it had to be brought from a quarry in the midlands. There it was loaded into barges and came down the river easily enough following the current. On arrival near the manor it was loaded into carts and drawn by oxen to the site. Usually Roger spotted the barge as it appeared round the bend in the river far upstream, and he saw the unloading through with as much keenness as if he were in charge.<br><br> The walls were built of rough stone, carefully bedded and fitted together, but the larger blocks were tooled on the spot to fit corners and window ledges and arches. The master mason was very tolerant with the lord's son, and perhaps he would have been with any boy. Roger was allowed to try his hand. He was shown how every stone has a grain like wood and must be placed with the grain lying horizontally, or it will split. The mason handled the stone lovingly.<br><br> "There's good stone and bad stone," he said, "you could say it's living. Put your hand on a natural boulder warm in the sun, you can feel it's not dead, like bone for instance. The sun makes no difference to bone. Some pieces of stone are by nature bad, you can't do anything with them, and some are solid and loyal and will last for ever. Besides that, stone takes something from what it is used for. I've got a piece here that's going into your wall. It didn't come from the quarry but from a stone merchant. It came out of a little church that the Vikings burnt down. It has got a Saxon cross on it. I'm keeping it for the upper room."<br><br> Usually Roger spent the morning learning the arts of knighthood, for he would be a fighting knight when he grew up. He was dressed in imitation armor of stiff leather, and carried a wooden shield, and then on horseback practiced the rudiments of the kind of fighting peculiar to knights. He would have to be a skilled and daring rider, and also to understand hawking. His sisters also rode and hawked, but demurely on led horses, for they sat sideways. Now in the commotion of building, they, poor girls, were kept indoors spinning and weaving and embroidering with fine bone needles all the linen that would be needed for the grander house. They envied even the milkmaid who went out into the meadow at milking time, for cows were not brought into the byre, but, Norman fashion, the girl went out with a yoke across her shoulders and two wooden buckets and sought out each of the cows scattered across the common to milk it where it stood.<br><br> Unlike his sisters, Roger was at a loose end. When he had had his riding lesson and groomed his pony he must find occupation for himself. The building had been going on for such a time that he was beginning to lose interest, but when at long last the builders reached the upper level his enthusiasm was strongly revived. He was thrilled with the pulleys for lifting the large stones of the window-heads into place. He longed to be allowed to be one of the team who hauled on the rope to raise them, to have a hand himself in making these windows, which seemed to him, who had hitherto known only small slots between wooden uprights, the most glorious light-giving invention. He had seen them of course in the new church, but to have them in the house where he was to live was almost unthinkable. When he saw the first one in position in the still-roofless wall, its arch and the two lights silhouetted against the sky, and a huge white cumulus cloud towering behind it, his heart leapt with pride.<br>Copyright � 1976 by L.

Now Red Pine (the lovely pen name that the American poet and Chinese scholar Bill Porter assumes for his translation work) celebrates Wei's life and achievement in a big new anthology, <i>In Such Hard Times</i>...Reading him is like listening to Mozart, there's something healing about the calm profundity with which he spins pain and disaster." <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p> [Translator] Red Pine&#x2019;s out-of-the-mainstream work is uncanny and clearheaded.&#x201d; <i>Kyoto Journal</i></p><p> Red Pine&#x2019;s succinct and informative notes for each poem are core samples of the cultural, political, and literary history of China.&#x201d; <i>Asian Reporter</i></p><p>Wei Ying-wu (737 791) is considered one of the great poets of the T&#x2019;ang Dynasty, ranked alongside such poets as Tu Fu, Li Pai, and Wang Wei. Strangely, though, only a handful of Wei Ying-wu&#x2019;s poems have ever been translated into English.</p><p>True to his reputation as one of the world&#x2019;s leading translators of Chinese, Red Pine (a.k.a. Bill Porter) translates 175 of Wei&#x2019;s poems and demonstrates why he is one of the world&#x2019;s great poets.&#x201d; Presented in a bilingual Chinese-English format, with extensive notes and an informative introduction, <i>In Such Hard Times</i> is a long-overdue world premiere.</p><p><i>A courtyard of bamboo in the snow at midnight</i><br><i>a lone lantern a book on my table</i><br><i>if I hadn&#x2019;t encountered the teachings of inaction</i><br><i>how else could I have gained this life of leisure</i></p><p><b>Wei Ying-wu</b> (737-791) is considered one of the great poets of the T&#x2019;ang Dynasty.

Born into an artistocratic family on the decline, Wei served in several government posts without distinction. He also disdained the literary establishment of his day, so he fashioned a poetic style counter to the mainstream: one of profound simplicity. Red Pine (aka Bill Porter) is one of the world&#39;s leading translators of Chinese literary and religious texts. After dropping out of a Columbia University Ph.D. program, Red Pine moved to a Buddhist monastery in Taiwan; he eventually became a popular radio journalist in Hong Kong, famous for his descriptions of traveling around mainland China.Starred Review. Chinese experts rate Wei among the greatest poets of China's classic era, right alongside Tu Fu and Li Po; severe, self-critical, openly political and prone at times to self-pity, Wei remains obscure in the West and shouldn't be. The prolific translator Red Pine has made a striking selection, 170 poems in a facing-page edition with storylike notes on each. Born to privilege in the last flowering of the T'ang dynasty, Wei (c. 737&#x2013;791) entered the civil service in his youth and became a provincial official in a time of civil war, enforcing harsh laws he disliked, missing his literary friends and welcoming time alone. Some of Wei's poems are pellucid, brief impressions: the sound of mallets at the foot of leafless hills. Others give moral advice, or show introspection: Governing a prefecture takes no special skill/ what bothers me is eating for free. Wei's poetry reflects a sensibility and history that only Chinese traditions could produce. Some of its powers come from Wei's whole life, others inhere in single vivid moments: when will I hold someone's hand again/ the flowers overhead look like sleet. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And why is this fear described as &#34;the power of the devil&#34;? And most importantly, how are we-as individuals and as faith communities-to be set free from this slavery to death? In another creative interdisciplinary fusion, Richard Beck blends Eastern Orthodox perspectives, biblical text, existential psychology, and contemporary theology to describe our slavery to the fear of death, a slavery rooted in the basic anxieties of self-preservation and the neurotic anxieties at the root of our self-esteem. Driven by anxiety-enslaved to the fear of death-we are revealed to be morally and spiritually vulnerable as &#34;the sting of death is sin&#34; Beck argues that in the face of this predicament, resurrection is experienced as liberation from the slavery of death in the martyrological, eccentric, cruciform, and communal capacity to overcome fear in living fully and sacrificially for others.</p><p>Richard Beck is Professor of Psychology at Abilene Christian University. He is the author of Unclean (2011) and The Authenticity of Faith (2012). Richard also writes about the intersections of psychology and theology at his popular and award-winning blog Experimental Theology.Richard Beck's new book seamlessly integrates deep theological reflection with sound psychological insight while never compromising either discipline. Liberating ideas about fear, sin, and death from the mire of abstraction, <i>The Slavery of Death</i> invites believers to discover and embrace true freedom together at the far side of the cross, a freedom reflected in and essential to the very nature of God. This book is a gift to the church. --Jamie Arpin-Ricci, author, <i>The Cost of Community</i><br><br>With Eastern Orthodox tradition and the work of modern theologians like McGill, Stringfellow, and Kelsey in one hand, and social science texts in the other, Richard Beck analyzes our culture of death in this compelling book. What can liberate us from this demonic power that is feared and fetishized, institutionalized and internalized, and reconfigure our self-enclosed identities? The kenotic love of the risen Christ! With the colloquial skills of a gifted teacher, Beck has written a prophetic, practical--and urgent--manifesto. --Kim Fabricius, minister, the United Reformed Church (UK)<br><br>It's an age-old Faustian tale. We conspire with demonic principalities and powers to cheat death and save ourselves. Such idols, Richard Beck warns, inexorably enslave and damn us. He follows this indictment, however, with a prophetic analysis that is nothing short of an emancipation proclamation. Christ's resurrection not only burst the gates of hell and destroyed death's sting, but also freed us from the enslaving addiction of self-empowerment--resurrecting us for self-expenditure and sacrificial love. --Richard Goode, co-editor, <i>And the Criminals With Him</i></p><h2>The Color of Truth: McGeorge Bundy and William Bundy: Brothers in Arms</h2><p><b>"Grey is the color of truth."</b> <br> So observed Mac Bundy in defending America's intervention in Vietnam. Kai Bird brilliantly captures this ambiguity in his revelatory look at Bundy and his brother William, two of the most influential policymakers of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. It is a portrait of fiercely patriotic, brilliant and brazenly self-confident men who directed a steady escalation of a war they did not believe could be won. Bird draws on seven years of research, nearly one hundred interviews, and scores of still-classified top secret documents in a masterful reevaluation of America's actions throughout the Cold War and Vietnam.</p><p>This dual biography of the brothers who were top aides to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson is an outstanding study of the mindset that allowed the United States to become slowly ensnared in the Vietnam War. Both McGeorge Bundy, a national security advisor, and William Bundy, a senior official at the Pentagon and State Department, were liberal anti-Communists trying to balance American interests in Southeast Asia between what they considered the dangerous extremes of both Left and Right. They came under enormous criticism for their roles, but author Kai Bird argues that newly declassified documents "show that the Bundys and other decision-makers registered deep doubts about the American enterprise in Vietnam and did so far earlier than most historians had thought." This hardly exonerates them, in Bird's view: "They knew how badly the war was going as early as 1964-65, yet they found a way to persist in folly." Their tale didn't end in the 1960s. McGeorge Bundy, for instance, went on to head the Ford Foundation for 13 years, where he played an enormously important role in shaping modern liberalism. Bird, a Guggenheim Fellow and contributing editor to <i>The Nation</i>, tells the Bundys' story with great clarity and sound judgment; <i>The Color of Truth</i> is a surprisingly absorbing book. <i>--John Miller</i>Kai Bird is the co-author with Martin J.

Set in Southeast London, <i>Brand New Ancients </i>finds the mythic in the mundane. It is the story of two half-brothers, Thomas and Clive, unknown to each other -- Thomas the result of an affair between his mother and Clive's father. Tempest, with wide-ranging empathy, takes us inside the passionless marriage of Jane and Kevin -- the man who suspects Thomas is not his son, but loves him just the same -- and the neighboring home of Mary and Brian, where betrayal has not been so placidly accepted. The sons of these two households -- quiet, creative Thomas and angry, destructive Clive -- will cross paths in adolescence, their fates converging with mortal fury.</p><p>These characters' loves, their infidelities, their disappointments and their small comforts -- these, Tempest argues, are timeless. Our lives and our choices are no less important than those of history and myth.

He tells the stories of the inventor of the bentwood chair, Michael Thonet, and of the creators of the first molded-plywood chair, Charles and Ray Eames. He reveals the history of chairs to be a social history&#x2015;of different ways of sitting, of changing manners and attitudes, and of varying tastes. The history of chairs is the history of who we are. We learn how the ancient Chinese switched from sitting on the floor to sitting in a chair, and how the iconic chair of Middle America&#x2015;the BarcaLounger&#x2015;traces its roots back to the Bauhaus. Rybczynski weaves a rich tapestry that draws on art and design history, personal experience, and historical accounts. And he pairs these stories with his own delightful hand-drawn illustrations: colonial rockers and English cabrioles, languorous chaise longues and no-nonsense ergonomic task chairs&#x2015;they&#x2019;re all here.</p><p> The famous Danish furniture designer Hans Wegner once remarked, &#x201c;A chair is only finished when someone sits in it.&#x201d; As Rybczynski tells it, the way we choose to sit and what we choose to sit on speak volumes about our values, our tastes, and the things we hold dear.</p></p><p><b>Witold Rybczynski</b> is a writer and an emeritus professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of <i>How Architecture Works</i> and <i>Mysteries of the Mall</i> and has written about architecture and design for <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>,<i> The New York Times</i>, and <i>Slate</i>. Among his award-winning books are <i>Home</i>, <i>The Most Beautiful House in the World</i>, and <i>A Clearing in the Distance</i>, which won the J. Anthony Lukas Prize. He is the winner of the 2007 Vincent Scully Prize and the 2014 Design Mind Award from the National Design Awards.

Maybe you&#x2019;ll even find the one you&#x2019;re sitting in reflected in its pages: <i>Now I Sit Me Down</i> is charmingly illustrated with postage-stamp-size images of many of the chairs discussed&#x2015;all drawn with obvious care by the author.&#x201d; &#x2015;Henry Petroski, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Rybczynski adds another delightful volume to an already impressive shelf of books notable for formidable learning worn lightly and an infectious fascination with the way we craft the built environment . . . His prose has the engagingly conversational tone of an accomplished lecturer. You needn&#x2019;t be a student of architecture or design to enjoy <i>Now I Sit Me Down</i>, but you will certainly come away knowing a lot more about the practices and principles that shaped chairs throughout history.&#x201d; &#x2015;Wendy Smith, <i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p>The book is a slim, insightful introduction to the piece of furniture that shapes not only the way we sit, but the way we live, too.&#x201d; &#x2015;Mark Medley, <i>The Globe and Mail</i></p><p>&#x201c;Whether describing the Egyptian stool or its surprising descendant, the Hollywood director&#x2019;s chair, Rybczynski elegantly sums up the social trends and technological innovations that have conspired to change the way we sit . . .

Or so fascinating? Rybczynski . . . has a special knack for making everyday objects and ideas seem captivating, in part because he places them in a larger historical narrative.

The fate of entire platoons rests on her keen sense of smell. She's a Big Deal, and she likes it that way. Sometimes Cracker remembers when she was younger, and her previous owner would feed her hot dogs and let her sleep in his bed. That was nice, too. <br> <br> Rick Hanski is headed to Vietnam. There, he's going to whip the world and prove to his family and his sergeant -- and everyone else who didn't think he was cut out for war -- wrong. But sometimes Rick can't help but wonder that maybe everyone else <i>is</i> right. Maybe he should have just stayed at home and worked in his dad's hardware store. <br> <br> When Cracker is paired with Rick, she isn't so sure about this new owner. He's going to have to prove himself to <i>her</i> before <i>she's</i> going to prove herself to him. They need to be friends before they can be a team, and they <i>have</i> to be a team if they want to get home alive. <br> <br> Told in part through the uncanny point of view of a German shepherd, <i>Cracker!</i> is an action-packed glimpse into the Vietnam War as seen through the eyes of a dog and her handler. It's an utterly unique powerhouse of a book by the Newbery Medal-winning author of <i>Kira-Kira</i>.</p><p>Cynthia Kadohata is the author of the Newbery Medal&#x2013;winning book&nbsp;<i>Kira-Kira,&nbsp;</i>the National Book Award winner&nbsp;<i>The Thing About Luck</i>, the Jane Addams Peace Award and Pen USA Award winner&nbsp;<i>Weedflower</i>,&nbsp;<i>Cracker!, Outside Beauty</i>,&nbsp;<i>A Million Shades of Gray</i>,&nbsp;<i>Half a World Away</i>, and several critically acclaimed adult novels, including&nbsp;<i>The Floating World</i>. She lives with her hockey-playing son and dog in West Covina, California.In this fascinating dog story with a twist, Cracker, an intelligent German Shepherd, sadly has to leave his boy, Willie. He is trained and sent to Vietnam, where he and his handler, Rick, search for mines, sniff out enemy locations, and rescue missing soldiers. Despite the quirkiness of telling the story partly through the dog's viewpoint, this production is filled with authentic, gritty details of the realities of war. Kimberly Farr's voice is steady, calm, and reassuring, qualities that are helpful in tempering the emotional intensity and heart-wrenching suspense. Her accents sometimes sound forced, but she brings genuine expression to the main characters, Willie, Rick, and Cracker. And she delivers a terrifically hearty "Woof!"

His Worldwar Series began the story when a fleet of lizard-like aliens arrived to conquer Earth in May 1942. It ended in 1945 with a negotiated peace between the Race, the nuclear powers (the Reich, the USSR, and the USA), and the much-weakened Britain and Japan.<p> <i>Colonization: Second Contact</i> continues the saga, but you need not read the previous series to enjoy it. When the colonists arrive in 1962, they're unprepared for a half-conquered world. After several of their ships are destroyed by a nuclear missile of mysterious origin, they accuse the conquest forces of incompetence. Muslims in the conquered Middle East are staging an Intifada, the Chinese Communists continue guerrilla warfare against the invaders, and everyone's smuggling ginger, which is powerfully addictive among the Race and has unanticipated effects on the female colonists.</p><p> Turtledove's cast of characters includes sharply drawn alien soldiers and civilians as well as a mix of convincing historical and fictional humans from all over the world. He covers all the sixties issues: generational conflict, the drug culture, racial inequality, the threat of atomic apocalypse, and the frustration of soldiers in an unwinnable war. If you enjoy alternate history and old B movies, this book's for you. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>In the extraordinary Worldwar tetralogy, set against the backdrop of World War II, Harry Turtledove, the "Hugo-winning master of alternate SF" (Publishers Weekly), wove an explosive saga of world powers locked in conflict against an enemy from the stars.

Code named Operation Citadel,&#x201d; the German offensive would cut through the bulge in the eastern front that had been created following Germany&#x2019;s retreat at the battle of Stalingrad. But the Soviets, well-informed about Germany&#x2019;s plans through their network of spies, had months to prepare. Two million men supported by 6,000 tanks, 35,000 guns, and 5,000 aircraft convened in Kursk for an epic confrontation that was one of the most important military engagements in history, the epitome of total war.&#x201d; It was also one of the most bloody, and despite suffering seven times more casualties, the Soviets won a decisive victory that became a turning point in the war. With unprecedented access to the journals and testimonials of the officers, soldiers, political leaders, and citizens who lived through it, <i>The Battle of the Tanks</i> is the definitive account of an epic showdown that changed the course of history.</p><p>Lloyd Clark is a senior academic in the Department of War Studies at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and Professorial Research Fellow in War Studies, Humanities Research Institute, at University of Buckingham.

He places the great battle in its context, relating it to the events that preceded, and those which followed. It is in the telling of this dramatic tale that author Clark excels. In The Battle of the Tanks, it is the men who fought there who tell the story of the great and fateful encounter.&#x201d; <i>The New York Journal of Books<br><br>"His narrative is both moving in its use of testimony of ordinary soldiers and insightful in its interpretation of the generals&#x2019; strategy." <i>The Sunday Times</i> (UK)<br><br>"A comprehensive analysis of WWII&#x2019;s greatest land battle and one of history&#x2019;s greatest armor engagements. [Clark] blends archival research, participant interviews, and professional insight in presenting the genesis, conduct, and consequences of the Battle of Kursk. Particularly effective is his integration of foxhole and tank-crew perspectives with broader discussion of the course of a headdown slugging match that decisively tipped the Eastern Front&#x2019;s balance in favor of a resurgent Red Army. With this account, Clark confirms his reputation as one of Britain&#x2019;s outstanding scholars of operational military history." <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"A leading British military historian reconsiders the events of World War II this time, on the decisive yet less-trammeled Eastern Front. In this deeply informed overview, Clark offers an authoritative appraisal of the total war&#x201d; engulfing both Germany and the Soviet Union. Vigorous depictions of German and Soviet military leaders alternate with the words of ordinary soldiers and richly described specifications of military hardware." <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"An experienced and literate military historian gives us a stellar account of the Battle of Kursk in 1943, one of the more obscure of WWII&#x2019;s decisive battles... The German Panzer forces on the Eastern Front never recovered their offensive capabilities, and the author has shown why in vivid, sometimes harrowing, detail, making extensive use of Russian sources only recently made available. A major addition to the literature of the Eastern Front, the decisive land theater of WWII." <i>Booklist</i><br><br> Lloyd Clark belongs to a new generation of British military historians who appeal to both scholars and general readers; he has written successful works on Anzio and the British Rhine campaign of 1944 45. This offering is no less solid: well researched and well written, it integrates frontline narratives and operational analysis. . . . What sets this work firmly apart, however, is Clark&#x2019;s recognition that while Kursk was a battle of the tanks,&#x2019; it was above all a soldiers&#x2019; battle. . . . Men, not machines, were the deciding factor.&#x201d; Dennis Showalter, <i>WWII Magazine</i></i></p><h2>Last Vanities: Stories</h2><p>&#34;Reading time is approximately four hours. Remembering time, as for its author, the rest of one&#39;s life,&#34; said Joseph Brodsky of Fleur Jaeggy&#39;s novel, Sweet Days of Displine. Now Jaeggy has come up with seven stories, each at some deep level in dark complicity with the others, all as terse and spare as if etched with a steel tip. A brooding atmosphere of horror, a disturbing and subversive propensity for delirium haunts the violent gestures and chilly irony of these tales.

While studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, he augmented his income by writing stories &#x2014; a pursuit that led to the creation of Sherlock Holmes, one of literature's best-loved detectives. Doyle also wrote many works of history and science fiction, plus plays and poetry. Set against the fourteenth-century war between England and France, <i>Sir Nigel</i> is an action-packed adventure classic, filled to the brim with history, conflict, chivalry, and a dash of romance.<br>This illustrated epic, which the author calls "the most complete, satisfying, and ambitious thing I have ever done," introduces young squire Nigel Loring as he leaves home to serve King Edward at the start of the Hundred Years' War. Though small of stature, Nigel possesses a "lion heart and the blood of a hundred soldiers thrilling in his veins" that propel him to accomplish heroic acts in his quest for knighthood. The star upon his path is his beloved Lady Mary, who waits for him to complete three courageous acts so he can win her hand in marriage.

Kennedy Book Award Grand Prize</b><br>"An original, wise and courageous work that moves beyond sterile arguments and lifts the discussion of race and justice to a new and more hopeful level."--Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.<br>In this groundbreaking, powerfully reasoned, lucid work that is certain to provoke controversy, Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy takes on a highly complex issue in a way that no one has before. Kennedy uncovers the long-standing failure of the justice system to protect blacks from criminals, probing allegations that blacks are victimized on a widespread basis by racially discriminatory prosecutions and punishments, but he also engages the debate over the wisdom and legality of using racial criteria in jury selection. He analyzes the responses of the legal system to accusations that appeals to racial prejudice have rendered trials unfair, and examines the idea that, under certain circumstances, members of one race are statistically more likely to be involved in crime than members of another.<br>"An admirable, courageous, and meticulously fair and honest book."--New York Times Book Review<br>"This book should be a standard for all law students."--Boston Globe</p><p>There&#39;s no question that nowadays, racial issues pose one of the biggest obstacles to the fair workings of our criminal justice system, but exactly how these issues come into play and what to do about them is a subtler matter. In this book, Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor who is black, applies his precise command of the relevant legal language and legal background to explain and evaluate for the general reader various current ideas about how race is and should be involved in meting out criminal justice. His basic stance is that liberals and conservatives have more common ground on race and law than it seems at first, and that blacks have suffered more from being underprotected by law enforcement than from being mistreated as suspects or defendants, even though it is the latter allegation that seems to draw the most attention from those who view the courts through racial lenses.<b>Randall Kennedy</b>&nbsp;is the Michael R.

Collected here are insightful teachings on the challenges of leadership on all levels, from organizational management to political statecraft. The translator, Thomas Cleary, has chosen and arranged these teachings to emphasize the most valuable lessons of Taoist wisdom for modern Western readers. Like Cleary's best-selling translation of <i>The Art of War </i> by Sun Tzu, this work will serve as an enlightening guide for people in business, politics, and government.</p><p>Thomas Cleary holds a PhD in East Asian Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University and a JD from the University of California, Berkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law. He is the translator of over fifty volumes of Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian, and Islamic texts from Sanskrit, Chinese, Japanese, Pali, and Arabic.The teachings of eight Taoist masters of the Han dynasty are covered in this presentation. Passages include those on leadership, society and war. The teachings are as current today as they were 2000 years ago. The introduction is superior, and Warrilow reads the text beautifully. His voice is clear, accentuating the classicism of the words. Although the text is abridged, the selections are cohesive. Listeners will ask for the book after finishing the tape. E.L.C.

Who wouldn&#x2019;t hit the snooze to get another nine minutes of sleep? No one, that&#x2019;s who. Subsequently, I almost always oversleep. Stupid snooze button.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t have time for breakfast. Instead, I gobbled a pair of chocolate Pop Tarts while waiting for the bus. Mmmm...chocolate. My mom would have approved (who do you think got me hooked on the darned things?), but a nutritionist would have smacked me upside the head with her calorie counter.</p><p>The bus was, of course, late. You gotta love the Minnesota Transit system. Six buses for a population area of a quarter million. When they weren&#x2019;t late, they were early I&#x2019;d lost count of the number of times I&#x2019;d stepped outside only to see my bus disappearing down the street. Schedule? What schedule?</p><p>When the bus, late again, finally did lumber into sight, I climbed on and sat down...in gum.</p><p>At a nine A.M. meeting (to which I arrived at 9:20), I found out the recession (the one the economists have been denying for years) had hit me right between the eyes: I had been laid off. Not unexpected the last time good old Hamilton &amp; Sons had been profitable I&#x2019;d been in high school but it hurt, just the same. Losing a job is the worst. You know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that somebody doesn&#x2019;t want you. Doesn&#x2019;t matter if the reasons are personal, financial, or practical. They just don&#x2019;t want you.</p><p>Hamilton &amp; Son, realizing about a year too late that they had to slash costs, decided administrative layoffs were the way to go as opposed to, say, cutting the six figure salaries of senior management. The clerks and secretaries had been deemed expendable. But vengeance would be ours. Without us, those twits couldn&#x2019;t even send a fax, much less run the company.</p><p>With this cheerful thought, I cleaned out my desk, ignored the way my coworkers were avoiding looking at me, and scuttled home. I consoled myself by stopping at the Dairy Queen for a blueberry milkshake. Signs of spring: robins, new grass, and Dairy Queen opening for the season.</p><p>As I walked through my front door, still slurping, I saw my answering machine light winking at me like a small black dragon. The message was from my stepmonster, and from the racket in the background, she was calling from her salon: &#x201c;Your father and I won&#x2019;t be able to make it to your party tonight...I&#x2019;m on new medication and I we just can&#x2019;t. Sorry.&#x201d; Sure you are, jerk. &#x201c;Have fun without us.&#x201d; No problem. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;ll meet someone tonight.&#x201d; Translation: Maybe some poor slob will marry you.</p><p>My stepmonster had, from day one, related to me in only one way: as a rival for her new husband&#x2019;s affections. Worse, she never hesitated to play the depression card to get out of something that was important to me. This ceased bothering me about a week after I met her, so I suppose it was just as well.</p><p>I went into the kitchen to feed my cat, and that&#x2019;s when I noticed she&#x2019;d run away again. Always looking for adventure, my Giselle (although it&#x2019;s more like I&#x2019;m her Betsy).</p><p>I looked at the clock. My, my. Not even noon. Time to do the laundry and gouge out my eyes, and the day would be complete.</p><p>Happy birthday to me.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As it turned out, we had a freak April snowstorm, and my party was postponed. Just as well...I didn&#x2019;t feel like going out, putting on a happy face, and drinking too many daiquiris. The Mall of America is a terrific place, but I&#x2019;ve got to be in the mood for overpriced retail, rowdy weekend crowds, and six-dollar drinks.</p><p>Nick called around eight P.M., and that was my day&#x2019;s sole bright spot. Nick Berry was a superfine detective who work ed out of St. Paul. I&#x2019;d been attacked a couple of months before, and...</p><p>Okay, well, &#x201c;attacked&#x201d; is putting it mildly. Like using the word &#x201c;unfortunate&#x201d; to describe World War II. I don&#x2019;t like to talk about it to think about it but what happened was, a bunch of creeps jumped me as I was leaving Khan&#x2019;s Mongolian Barbecue (all you can eat for $11.95, including salad, dessert, and free refills quite the bargain if you don&#x2019;t mind your clothes reeking of garlic for hours).</p><p>I have no idea what my attackers wanted they didn&#x2019;t take my purse or try to rape me or even babble about government conspiracies.</p><p>They came out of nowhere literally. One minute I was yawning and fumbling for my keys, the next I was surrounded. They clawed and bit at me like a bunch of rabid squirrels while I fended them off with the toes of my Manolo Blahniks and screamed for help as loud as I could...so loud I couldn&#x2019;t speak above a whisper for three days. They stank worse than my kitchen that time I went to the Cape for two weeks and forgot to empty my garbage before I left. They all had long hair and funny-colored eyes and they never talked to me.</p><p>Help didn&#x2019;t come, but the bad guys ran away. Maybe they were rattled by my voice when I scream, dogs howl. Or maybe they didn&#x2019;t like the way I stank of garlic. Whatever the reason, they ran away skittered away, actually. While I leaned against my car, concentrating on not passing out, I glanced back and it looked like a few of them were on all fours. I struggled mightily not to yark up my buffet, ginger tea, and sesame bread no way was I pissing away that $11.95 and then called 911 on my cell phone.</p><p>Detective Nick was assigned to the case, and he interviewed me in the hospital while they were disinfecting the bite marks. All fifteen of them. The intern who took care of me smelled like cilantro and kept humming the theme from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Off-key. This was actually more annoying than the sting of antiseptic.</p><p>Anyway, Detective Nick called and we chatted and, long story shot, I promised to come in to look through the Big Book o&#x2019; Bad Guys one more time. And I would. For myself, to feel empowered, but mostly to see Nick, who was exactly my height (six feet), with dark blond hair cut regulation-short, light blue eyes, a swimmer&#x2019;s build, and dimples! He looked like an escapee from a Mr. Hardbody calendar. I&#x2019;ve broken the law, Officer, take me in.</p><p>Making Nick my eye candy would be the closest I&#x2019;d gotten to getting laid in...what year was it? Not that I&#x2019;m a prude. I&#x2019;m just picky. I treat myself to the nicest, most expensive shoes I can get my hands on, which isn&#x2019;t easy on a secretary&#x2019;s budget, and never mind all the money my dad keeps trying to throw at me. If I used his money, they wouldn&#x2019;t be my shoes. They&#x2019;d be his. Anyway, I save up for months to buy the dumb things, and they only have to go on my feet.</p><p>Yep, that&#x2019;s me in a nutshell: Elizabeth Taylor (don&#x2019;t start! I&#x2019;ve heard &#x2018;em all), single, dead-end job (well, not anymore), lives with her cat. And I&#x2019;m so dull, the fucking cat runs away about three times a month just to get a little excitement. </p><p>And speaking of the cat...was that her telltale Riaaaaoooowwww! from the street? Well, super. Gisele hated the snow. She had probably been looking for a little spring lovin&#x2019; and got caught in the storm. Now she was outside waiting for rescue. And when I did rescue her, she&#x2019;d be horribly affronted and wouldn&#x2019;t make eye contact for the rest of the week.</p><p>I slipped into my boots and headed into the yard. It was still snowing, but I could see Gisele crouched in the middle of the street like a small blob of shadow, one with amber-colored eyes. I wasted ten seconds calling her why do I call cats? then clomped through my yard into the street,</p><p>Normally this wouldn&#x2019;t be a problem, as I live at the end of the block and it&#x2019;s a quite street. However, in the snow on the icy roads, the driver didn&#x2019;t see me in time. When he did, he did the absolute worst thing: slammed on his brakes. That pretty much sealed my doom.</p><p>Dying doesn&#x2019;t hurt. I know that sounds like a crock, some touchy-feely nonsense meant to make people feel better about biting the big one. But the fact is, your body is so traumatized by what&#x2019;s happening, it shuts down your nerve endings. Not only did dying not hurt, I didn&#x2019;t feel the cold. And it was only ten degrees that night.</p><p>I handled it badly, I admit. When I saw he was going to plow into me, I froze like a deer in headlights. A big, dumb, blond deer who had just paid for touch-up highlights. I couldn&#x2019;t move, not even to save my life.</p><p>Gisele certainly could; the ungrateful little wretch scampered right the hell out of there. Me, I went flying. The car hit me at forty miles an hour, which was survivable, and knocked me into a tree, which was not.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t hurt, as I said, but there was tremendous pressure, all over my body. I heard things break. I heard my own skull shatter it sounded like someone was chewing ice in my ear. I felt myself bleed, felt liquid pouring from everywhere. I felt my bladder let go involuntarily for the first time in twenty-six years. In the dark, my blood on the snow looked black.</p><p>The last thing I saw was Gisele sitting on my porch, waiting for me to let her in. The last thing I heard was the driver, screaming for help.</p><p>Well, not the last. But you know what I mean.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Cage</h2><p><p>First published in 1975, <i>The Cage</i> was a graphic novel before there was a name for the genre. Considered an early masterpiece of the genre, the Canadian cult comic has been out of print for decades. The new edition includes an introduction by Canadian comics master and Lemony Snicket collaborator Seth (<i>Palookaville; It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken</i>).</p><br><br><p>Cryptic and disturbing, like Dave Gibbons (<i>Watchmen</i>) illustrating a film by Ozu, <i>The Cage</i> spurns narrative for atmosphere, guiding us through a series of disarrayed rooms and desolate landscapes, tracking a stuttering and circling time and a sequence of objects: headphones, inky stains, bedsheets. It's not about where we're going but how &#x2013; if &#x2013; we get there.</p><br></p><p>Martin Vaughn-James (1943-2009) was a painter and groundbreaking comics artist who published three of his early works with Coach House Press: <i>The Projector</i> (1971), <i>The Park</i> (1972) and <i>The Cage</i> (1975). He was born in England and spent much of his youth in Australia, before moving to Canada to do his groundbreaking comics work in the 1970s. Vaughn-James is widely recognized as a pioneer in the development of the graphic novel. Later in life, Vaughn-James moved to Belgium, where he focused on painting. His works were the subject of several personal exhibitions in Brussels and Paris. Vaughn-James also published two works of prose fiction: <i>Night Train</i> (1989) and <i>The Tomb of Zwaab</i> (1991).Starred Review. First published in 1975, this work foreshadowed the rise of the graphic novel. While promoted by insiders in the years that followed, it is not well-known. Its relative obscurity may be due to the late Vaughn-James&#39;s devotion to his highly personal vision. Presented here are a series of black-and-white drawings, nearly clinical in their precision, detailing an enigmatic structure in an unspecified place and time. Accompanying the illustrations are bits of text, which are perhaps explicative in their unseen whole but as fragments offer only tantalizing hints of possible unity. Nonlinear in its approach to both space and time, the study mixes the banally familiar with the disturbingly alien. What emerges is not comprehensible in any mundane sense, but it presents enough of an illusion of a greater whole lurking just out of frame to be addictively engaging. It is a masterpiece, demonstrating a level of skill and insight very few have even aspired to in the nearly 40 years since its initial publication. With an introduction by Canadian comics star and Lemony Snicket collaborator Seth, this work is strongly recommended for every true fan of the graphic arts.

Kennedy. But as a child born into poverty in the 1930s, Robert was raised by his grandmother to think differently about success. For example, "The best way to influence others is to be helpful," she told him. And, "You can&#x2019;t go wrong by doing right." <br> &nbsp;<br> Fueled by these lessons on humble, principled service, Brown went on to play a pivotal, mostly unseen role alongside the great and the powerful of our time: trailing the mob in 1950s Harlem with a young Robert F. Kennedy; helping the white corporate leadership at Woolworth integrate their lunch counters; channeling money from American businesses to the Civil Rights movement; accompanying Coretta Scott King, at her request, to Memphis the day after her husband had been shot; advising Richard Nixon on how to support black entrepreneurship; becoming the only person allowed to visit Nelson Mandela in Pollsmoor prison in Cape Town.<br> &nbsp;<br> Full of unbelievable moments and reminders that the path to influence runs through a life of generosity, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG DOING RIGHT blends a heartwarming, historically fascinating account with memorable lessons that will speak to the dreamer in all of us.</p><p><b>Robert Brown</b> is CEO and founder of B&amp;C International, a global management consulting firm, and founder of the International BookSmart Foundation, a nonprofit that to date has shipped over 5 million books to over 300 libraries in Africa. A trusted advisor to some of the most influential individuals, corporations and movements of the 20th and 21st centuries, Brown advised and raised money for the late Martin Luther King, Jr., and was contracted by companies like F.W. Woolworth Corporation, A&amp;P Supermarkets, and Wrangler to handle corporate communications during pivotal moments of the civil rights movement. Later, as a special assistant to President Richard Nixon, he was credited with starting and developing the U. S. Minority Enterprise Program, which brought millions of dollars in support to black-owned businesses.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>You Don&#x2019;t Have to Be Rich to Give</p><p>I grew up with my brother, bill, in my grandparents&#x2019; house in High Point, North Carolina. We lived in Burns Hill, one of the poorest of the colored neighborhoods in town. White folks had homes along paved streets. Blacks lived where the pavement ended. Our humble wood-frame bungalow was located at 1309 East Commerce Street, where there was neither commerce nor a street.</p><p>The Hill was mostly peaceful in my 1940s boyhood, but it was not a place that inspired much hope. Families were from the working poor. Most scraped by on skimpy earnings, but they took care of each other, sharing what little they had because serving others was how we all survived.</p><p>One day when I was not yet ten years old, a man reeking of sour wine and wet garbage walked up to our porch. I was sitting on our house&#x2019;s wooden front steps, and my &#x201c;Mama,&#x201d; my grandmother, was in her chair on the porch. The man stood at the bottom of the steps, unsteady on his feet and red-eyed, but cautious and respectful.</p><p>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t had nothin&#x2019; to eat for two days, Miss Nellie,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have no money to buy food.&#x201d;</p><p>I stood up, suspicious of the beggar and protective of my grandmother. But Mama had no fear of him.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on in here, boy,&#x201d; she said to the man.</p><p>He climbed the stairs with surprising speed, followed her into the house, and took a seat at the kitchen table. Mama went right to work. She broke off chunks from a huge pan of homemade bread and dished up a bowl of hot beans. The man ate until his belly stopped growling. Then he let fly a roaring belch, stood up from the table, gently placed his bowl in the sink, and said: &#x201c;I sure do appreciate it, Miss Nellie. The Lord will bless you.&#x201d;</p><p>Mama turned from the sink and sighed. The man had to know he was in for one of her church lectures, but no doubt he&#x2019;d figured the meal would be worth it.</p><p>&#x201c;Do the right thing, now, and get your life straight,&#x201d; Mama told him, looking him in the eye. &#x201c;Go to church on Sunday and your life will change for the better.&#x201d;</p><p>He bowed his head, accepting his penance, and then made his way out the door and down the steps with newfound energy. Mama washed his bowl and returned to her chair on the porch. I took my place on the steps. After a while, I gathered the courage to say what was on my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mama, why on earth do you give our food to these people who spend their days and nights drinkin&#x2019; and sleepin&#x2019; in the street, when you and Daddy and Bill and me work so hard to put it on the table?&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>My question must have touched something in her. Mama waved for me to come up and sit in the chair with her. When I&#x2019;d settled in, she told me a story from the Bible, of the time when Jesus knocked on someone&#x2019;s door for help, but they turned Him away because He was dressed in rags.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;If I never teach you anything else,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I want to teach you that one thing--you never know which way the Lord will come to you. He will test you to see if you follow His teachings. So, life is all about giving, sharing, and serving others. If you give whatever you can, the Lord will give you more than you will ever need. He will take you up so high you won&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d;</p><p>Mama was wound up. I listened as a life&#x2019;s worth of lessons poured out of her.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Son, you don&#x2019;t have to be rich to give. We aren&#x2019;t rich, but we had food in the pot today. The Lord provided that food, and he provided it to me so I could share it with others. He gave us enough to share. That&#x2019;s what you should do with your life, Bobby. Whatever you get, make sure you try to help somebody else with it, because the Lord gives it to you so you can give it to somebody else.&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Nellie Brown was the light that woke me up in the morning and put me to bed at night. I adored her and took her words as gospel to live by. She had so much wisdom, so much compassion. Or, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, &#x201c;a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love.&#x201d;</p><p>My grandmother took in my brother and me shortly after we arrived in this world. Our natural birth mother, Gracie Mae Marshall, ran away from home early in her teens, and we were never clear on how she survived during those years. She&#x2019;d been sixteen when Bill was born, and I arrived two years later, on February 26, 1935. For most of my childhood, Gracie Mae was like an older sister or cousin who rarely came around.</p><p>We called our grandparents &#x201c;Mama&#x201d; and &#x201c;Daddy,&#x201d; throughout our lives. My grandfather, Marcus Lafayette Brown, worked in the boiler room of one of High Point&#x2019;s many furniture factories. A quiet and humble man by nature, he usually worked late shifts, so he left most of the grandchild-rearing to our grandmother. I felt blessed to have them as my parents, and couldn&#x2019;t have loved them more.&nbsp;</p><p>Before we complicated her life, Mama had worked full-time at the Southern Railway station in High Point. She cleaned the station and called the trains, shouting out arrival and departure times for all to hear. Mama was well known at church and at the railway station for her booming voice. Some claimed they could hear Mama&#x2019;s train calls five stops up and five stops down the line.</p><p>She had the same reach when calling us home from our ball fields, creek explorations, and friends&#x2019; homes. You could be six blocks away and underwater and still hear Miss Nellie calling us home to supper.</p><p>&#x201c;Billeeeeeeeeeee! Bobbeeeeee! Time for dinnahhhhhhh, boys!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>We scooted, too. Even the other kids listened to Mama. She had this air of authority that said, There will be no shady business when I&#x2019;m around.</p><p>Mama was an imposing woman. Big-boned and straight-backed, she had a regal bearing, no matter that she wore thrift shop dresses sometimes held together with safety pins. Whether singing in our church&#x2019;s gospel choir or canning vegetables, she called out Jesus with the best of them, and she set our moral compasses with lessons from the Bible.&nbsp;</p><p>The power and clarity of her voice certainly carried me a long way. Whenever my anger threatened to explode, her lessons of faith would come to me and help me redirect the rage toward positive action. I could well have ended up in prison, or worse, if it were not for all the Godly messages my Mama put in my heart as I was growing up.</p><p>By most expectations, I wasn&#x2019;t ever supposed to get off the Hill. In fact, there were times when it looked like I wouldn&#x2019;t make it past childhood at all. I coughed and wheezed throughout most days, and on two or three occasions, these fits led to pneumonia and weeks of confinement to my bed. Today, I know the coughing came from asthma, but back then, black children who coughed and wheezed weren&#x2019;t taken to the doctor. We were just considered poor and frail.</p><p>I was so skinny and pale, the other kids called me &#x201c;Light Bread.&#x201d; The nickname dogged me through elementary school. Since I lacked physical strength, I learned to get along through gentle persuasion and negotiation. The role of peacemaker suited me. If another boy got mad because he didn&#x2019;t have enough marbles, I&#x2019;d give him some of mine. I wanted everybody to be happy. When kids couldn&#x2019;t agree on whether to play baseball or go swimming, they left it up to me to decide. It&#x2019;s funny how our childhood ways offer previews into our adult lives.</p><p>To be truthful, I also had a childhood bodyguard who protected me from bullies as well as snakes and other dangers. My older brother, Bill, was nicknamed the &#x201c;Brown Bomber&#x201d; from early childhood. Bill was stump-necked, thick-shouldered, and fast with his fists. Later in his Air Force career, he became the middleweight champ of the Fifth Division. No one messed with Bill.</p><p>My brother and I spent at least part of every day in the garden, busting our butts to raise vegetables and fruit. While other kids in our neighborhood were playing stickball or hanging out, we had to hoe, weed, and pick. Mama had a knack for drawing spiritual and life lessons out of everyday experiences, especially gardening. Every spring, we&#x2019;d go to Hauser&#x2019;s farm goods and garden store on Wrenn Street to buy seeds and fertilizer for the garden. Mama always made sure we bought two or three pounds of black mustard seed, which came in a brown paper sack.</p></p><h2>THOR: RAGNAROKS</h2><p>Three Asgardian epics in one legendary volume!

It is precisely where we hurt most that the experience of the Orthodox Church has much to offer. The remedy is not a pep talk, or any simple admonitions to fight the good fight, cheer up, or think positively. Rather, the Orthodox method is to change the way we look at the human person (starting with ourselves). According to two thousand years of experience, Orthodoxy shows us how to &#34;be transformed by the renewing of our mind&#34;-a process that is aided by participation in the traditional ascetic practices and Mysteries of the Church. In this unique and accessible book, Archimandrite Meletios Webber first explores the role of mystery in the Christian life, then walks the reader through the seven major Mysteries of the Orthodox Church, showing the way to a richer, fuller life in Christ.</p><p>Fr. Meletios Webber is an Orthodox priest, and resides in the Netherlands. He graduated with a degree in theology from the University of Oxford. Fr. Mel also has a doctorate in counseling and many years of experience as a therapist.

It is the unhealable rift forced between a human being and a native place, between the self and its true home: its essential sadness can never be surmounted. And while it is true that literature and history contain heroic, romantic, glorious, even triumphant episodes in an exile&#x2019;s life, these are no more than efforts meant to overcome the crippling sorrow of estrangement. The achievements of exile are permanently undermined by the loss of something left behind forever. <br>&#x2014;Edward W. Said, &#x201c;Reflections on Exile&#x201d; <br>Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map (but they all look like that) I would put my finger on it and say, &#x201c;When I grow up I will go there.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Joseph Conrad, <i>Heart of Darkness</i> <br>It is not down in any map; true places never are. <br>&#x2014;Herman Melville, <i>Moby-Dick</i> <br>In the early hours of one September morning in 2008, there appeared on the doorstep of our home in South Kensington a brown-skinned man, haggard and gaunt, the ridges of his cheekbones set above an unkempt beard. He was in his late forties or early fifties, I thought, and stood at six foot or so, about an inch shorter than me. He wore a Berghaus jacket whose Velcro straps hung about unclasped and whose sleeves stopped short of his wrists, revealing a strip of paler skin above his right hand where he might once have worn a watch. His weathered hiking boots were fastened with unmatching laces, and from the bulging pockets of his cargo pants, the edges of unidentifiable objects peeked out. He wore a small backpack, and a canvas duffel bag rested on one end against the doorway. <br>The man appeared to be in a state of some agitation, speaking, as he was, not incoherently but with a strident earnestness and evidently without regard for introductions, as if he were resuming a broken conversation. Moments passed without my interruption as I struggled to place something in his aspect that seemed familiar, but what seized me suddenly was a German name I had not heard in nearly two decades. <br>At the time, the details of those moments did not impress themselves individually upon my consciousness; only later, when I started to put things down on paper, did they give themselves up to the effort of recollection. My professional life has been spent in finance, a business concerned with fine points, such as the small movement in exchange rates on which the fate of millions of dollars or pounds or yen could hang. But I think it is fair to say that whatever professional success I have had&#x2014;whatever professional success I <i>had</i>&#x2014;owes less to an eye for detail, which is common enough in the financial sector, than it does to a grasp of the broad picture in which wide patterns emerge and altogether new business opportunities become visible. Yet in taking on the task of reporting my conversations with Zafar, of collating and presenting all the material he provided, including volumes of rich and extensive notebooks, and of following up with my own research where necessary, it is the matter of representing details that has most occupied me, the details, to be precise, of his story, which is&#x2014;to risk putting it in such dramatic terms as Zafar would deprecate&#x2014;the story of the breaking of nations, war in the twenty-first century, marriage into the English aristocracy, and the mathematics of love. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I had not heard the name of the twentieth-century Austrian American mathematician Kurt G�del since a July weekend in New York, in the early 1990s, when I was visiting from London for a month of induction at the head offices of an investment bank into which I had recently been recruited. In some part I owe my recruitment to the firm, of which I later became a partner, to Zafar, who was already a derivatives trader in the bank&#x2019;s Wall Street offices and who had quickly established a reputation as a bright though erratic financial wizard. <br>Like Zafar, I was a student of mathematics at Oxford, but that, to put it imprecisely, was the beginning and the end of what we had in common. Mine was a privileged background. My father was born into a well-known landed family in Pakistan, where he met and married my mother. From there, the newlyweds went to Princeton, where they had me, making me an American citizen, and where my father obtained his doctorate before moving to Oxford so that he could take up a chair in physics. I am no genius and I know that without the best English schooling, I would not have been able to make as much as I have of the opportunities that came my way. <br>Zafar, however, arrived at Oxford in 1987 with a peculiar education, largely cobbled together by his own efforts, having been bored, when not bullied, out of one school after another. His family moved to Britain when he was no more than five years old, but then, at the age of twelve, or ten, by the new reckoning, he returned from Britain to rural Bangladesh for an interval of some years. <br>To him, Oxford must have seemed, as the expression goes, a long way to come. In our first term there, as we lounged in the Junior Common Room beside windows that gave out onto the garden quad, I observed that Zafar&#x2019;s pronunciation of the names of various Continental mathematicians&#x2014;Lebesgue, Gauss, Cauchy, Legendre, and Euler&#x2014;was grotesquely inaccurate. Though my first reaction, I am a little ashamed to say, was to find this rather amusing, I soon grasped that Zafar&#x2019;s errors marked his learning as his own, unlike mine, which carried the imprint of excellent schoolmasters. I must confess to a certain envy at the time. <br>The greatest difference between us, however, the significance of which I did not begin to ascertain until two years after our first meeting, lay in our social classes. As I mentioned, my father was an academic at Oxford, and my mother, after seeing off her only child to university, had returned to practicing as a psychotherapist, throwing herself into the retraining necessary to make up ground lost while raising me. My maternal grandfather had been Pakistan&#x2019;s ambassador to the United States and had moved in that country&#x2019;s elite internationalist circles; his closest friend had been Mohammad Asad, Pakistani ambassador to the UN shortly after 1947, a man who had begun life as Leopold Weiss, an Austro-Hungarian Jew born in what is now Ukraine. On the paternal side, my grandfather was an industrialist whose fortune, based on landholdings and tenancies, he augmented with the profits of shipping enterprises. <br>More than once during term time, Zafar came with me to lunch at my parents&#x2019; home, a large double-fronted, three-story Victorian house like many in that part of Oxford, though somewhat more capacious than the homes of most academics. To this day, whenever I return there, I feel an ease and lightness suffuse my being as I tread across the sweeping arc of the driveway, the gravel crunching underfoot, up to the stained glass of the wide front door. <br>On his first visit, Zafar stood at the threshold, wiping his feet over and over, his eyes darting about the large hall, his mouth slightly open. Evidently, he was, as people often are, astonished by the books, which were everywhere: shelves hanging wherever a wall would allow, books overflowing onto the floors, even leaning accordion-like on the staircase along the wall. In the family room, old issues of science magazines and journals, my father&#x2019;s subscriptions, sat in box files on shelves that scored the walls like lines on a writing pad. More recent issues lay about in small piles on a sideboard and on the floor. Zafar surveyed all this, but his eyes settled on the far wall that was covered with my father&#x2019;s collection of old maps, mounted and framed, of the Indian subcontinent under the British Raj, an area that today stretches from Pakistan across India to Bangladesh. Zafar drew up to the maps and it was apparent that his focus had fixed on one in particular, a map of the northeast corner of the subcontinent. Minutes passed as he stood silently gazing at it. Only when the time came to move to the summer room for lunch, and my father rested his hand on Zafar&#x2019;s shoulder, was my friend roused from his intense study. <br>When we left, Zafar suggested that we walk back to college, rather than take a bus, and I agreed, assuming that he wanted to discuss something. The mathematician Kurt G�del used to walk, setting off at sunset and returning after midnight, and found that his best ideas came to him in this stretch of time. Albert Einstein, who was deeply fond of G�del, and who was also at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, used to say in his later years, when he no longer engaged in much research, that he went to the institute daily only for the privilege of walking home with Kurt. <br>I thought Zafar wanted to talk, but in fact he was silent all the way down the Banbury Road. I sensed that he was searching not so much for a form of words but for clarity of thought. I recalled the map to which my friend was obviously drawn, and though I wanted to ask him what it was that had held his attention, I was reluctant to break the contemplative silence. On reaching Broad Street, as we approached the college gates, he spoke. You must meet my parents, he said, and that is where he left it. <br>More than a year passed before I did. On the day Zafar finished his final exams, in two years rather than three, when my own were still one year off, he informed me that his parents were to arrive at seven thirty the following morning. He asked me to meet him at the college&#x2019;s north entrance, to help him load his things, after which I was most welcome, he said, to come with them to a caf� in Headington for some breakfast, before the three of them, he and his parents, set off on the journey back to London. <br>At seven thirty on Saturday, Oxford was, and I expect it still is on every Saturday morning, perfectly quiet. It was odd that his parents should arrive so early; after all, the trip from London would have taken only an hour or thereabouts. The only explanation I could imagine was that Zafar was ashamed of his parents and did not want others to meet them, and that it was for this reason he had arranged to be collected at such an hour. <br>I found Zafar and his father already loading bags and boxes into a Datsun Sunny. His father had a beard and was wearing a skullcap. Standing in gray trousers, Hush Puppies, and a green V-neck sweater, he greeted me with a smile, tilting his head in what seemed a rather deferential way. <i>Asalaam-u-alaikum</i>, he said, before breaking into Urdu, a language that I know Bangladeshis of a certain age could speak but that is today, in the main, the language of Pakistanis. I supposed that Zafar had mentioned to him that my family was Pakistani originally. When I responded that my Urdu was very poor, Zafar&#x2019;s father looked disappointed, but then he took my hand into both of his and, rather unconfidently, repeated hello a few times. <br>Zafar&#x2019;s mother, standing by the car in an indigo sari that was pulled over her head, also greeted me with <i>Asalaam-u-alaikum</i>, but she bore herself with a self-assurance I did not see in his father. Pointing to the sandstone buildings around us, some of which had stood there for several hundreds of years, she commented on how old everything in Oxford looked. Can&#x2019;t they afford anything new? she asked earnestly. I looked at Zafar, who I am quite sure had heard this, but his eyes avoided mine. I understood then that in the two years he had spent at Oxford, a town less than sixty miles from London, this was the first time they had visited him, and this only as he was leaving the place stealthily one morning. <br>His parents&#x2019; pronunciation of <i>Asalaam-u-alaikum</i> seemed rather affected, although I was able to recognize it as the one adopted by certain pious Muslims, particularly by many of those who have undertaken the pilgrimage, the tour of duty, to the holy city of Mecca. There, amid the throng of thousands of Muslims from across the world, this greeting presumably acquires a special significance as mediator in a Babel of languages, the Nigerian greeting the Malaysian and the Bangladeshi greeting the Uzbek. Perhaps an Arab pronunciation of the phrase proclaims the spirit of brotherhood. Standing there, as he and his father finished loading the last of the boxes, I wondered if it was his parents&#x2019; religiosity of which Zafar was ashamed, though I understand now, having learned something of Zafar&#x2019;s own religious turn, that this was unlikely. I believe that while he was ashamed of his parents, he was more ashamed of being ashamed. <br>My own father had encouraged in me a sympathy toward the numinous claims of faith without ever surrendering the authority of science. He is a Muslim, my father; not a zealot but a quiet believer. He has always attended Friday prayers, which to him serve a social function, helping him to retain a link with his roots. While some connections gave in to the attrition of time and distance, others he deliberately let go because, as he explained, he was keen to see his son set his feet in the West. Apart from the Friday ritual, my father does not pray, not even once a day, let alone the five times ordained by Sunni Islam. He has never worn a skullcap, my father, and has never shown a drop of guilt for drinking alcohol. He drinks only on occasion, &#x201c;certainly at christenings and bar mitzvahs,&#x201d; he likes to say. &#x201c;Oh, look,&#x201d; he will remark, as he takes a bottle of fifteen-year-old single malt from the cabinet, &#x201c;this whisky has certainly come of age. Let us baptize it in the name of the father and the son.&#x201d; <br>Despite these impieties, which, it is fair to say, stand in the lee of a great Pakistani tradition, going back even to the country&#x2019;s founder, Jinnah, who was known to be rather partial to whisky, my father described himself then and does so now as a follower of the faith. When I once asked him how a physicist could believe in God, his answer was that physics did not explain everything and it did not answer the question, Why these laws and not others? For him, it was not enough to regard the world as being simply as it is. I would have to decide, he told me, whether science was enough for me. <br>My mother, on the other hand, had only disdain for religion. Islam, she said, oppressed women and encouraged people to accept their abysmal lot in this world in exchange for the promise of some fanciful happily ever afterlife. Not for her such opiates. <br>Zafar&#x2019;s mother interested me more than his father did. As I write this, I remember an intriguing article, which I came across in a journal in my parents&#x2019; home and which is now easily obtainable on the Internet. The article, written by the primatologist Frans de Waal, concerns his studies of kinship recognition among chimpanzees. De Waal and his colleague Lisa Parr, the article stated, presented their subject chimpanzees with the task of matching digitized portraits of unfamiliar female chimpanzees with portraits of their offspring. Astonishingly, they found that chimpanzees could match the faces of mothers and sons, thereby establishing kin recognition independent of previous experience with the individuals in question. <br>Had I been set the same task, I&#x2019;m quite sure I would have failed to match Zafar to his mother, for I saw no resemblance between them. In his father&#x2019;s aspect, a softness of the eyes, a roundness of face, and a tilting of the head&#x2014;all of these I recognized in Zafar.

Naipaul, or given its upheavals such a hauntingly human face. A perfect case in point is this riveting novel, a masterful and stylishly rendered narrative of emigration, dislocation, and dread, accompanied by four supporting narratives. <br><br> In the beginning it is just a car trip through Africa. Two English people&#x2014;Bobby, a civil servant with a guilty appetite for African boys, and Linda, a supercilious &#x201c;compound wife&#x201d;&#x2014;are driving back to their enclave after a stay in the capital. But in between lies the landscape of an unnamed country whose squalor and ethnic bloodletting suggest Idi Amin&#x2019;s Uganda. And the farther Naipaul&#x2019;s protagonists travel into it, the more they find themselves crossing the line that separates privileged outsiders from horrified victims. Alongside this Conradian tour de force are four incisive portraits of men seeking liberation far from home. By turns funny and terrifying, sorrowful and unsparing, <i>In A Free State</i> is Naipaul at his best.</p><p>&#x201c;V. S. Naipaul tells stories which show us ourselves and the reality we live in. His use of language is as precise as it is beautiful.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>The London Times</i> <br><br>&#x201c;A Tolstoyan spirit....The so-called Third World has produced no more brilliant literary artist.&#x201d; &#x2014;John Updike, <i>The New Yorker<br><br></i> &#x201c;The coolest literary eye and the most lucid prose we have.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;The New York </i>V.S. Naipaul was born in Trinidad in 1932. He came to England on a scholarship in 1950. He spent four years at University College, Oxford, and began to write, in London, in 1954. He pursued no other profession.<br> &nbsp;<br> His novels include <i>A House for Mr Biswas</i>, <i>The Mimic Men</i>, <i>Guerrillas</i>, <i>A Bend in the River</i>, and <i>The Enigma of Arrival</i>. In 1971 he was awarded the Booker Prize for <i>In a Free State</i>. His works of nonfiction, equally acclaimed, include <i>Among the Believers</i>, <i>Beyond Belief</i>, <i>The Masque of Africa</i>, and a trio of books about India: <i>An Area of Darkness</i>, <i>India: A Wounded Civilization</i> and <i>India: A Million Mutinies Now</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> In 1990, V.S. Naipaul received a knighthood for services to literature; in 1993, he was the first recipient of the David Cohen British Literature Prize. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001. He lived with his wife Nadira and cat Augustus in Wiltshire, and died in 2018.</p><h2>The Ghosts of Cannae: Hannibal and the Darkest Hour of the Roman Republic</h2><p><p><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER</b><br><br>For millennia, Carthage&#x2019;s triumph over Rome at Cannae in 216 B.C. has inspired reverence and awe. No general since has matched Hannibal&#x2019;s most unexpected, innovative, and brutal military victory. Now Robert L. O&#x2019;Connell, one of the most admired names in military history, tells the whole story of Cannae for the first time, giving us a stirring account of this apocalyptic battle, its causes and consequences.<br><br>O&#x2019;Connell brilliantly conveys how Rome amassed a giant army to punish Carthage&#x2019;s masterful commander, how Hannibal outwitted enemies that outnumbered him, and how this disastrous pivot point in Rome&#x2019;s history ultimately led to the republic&#x2019;s resurgence and the creation of its empire. Piecing together decayed shreds of ancient reportage, the author paints powerful portraits of the leading players, from Hannibal&#x2014;resolutely sane and uncannily strategic&#x2014;to Scipio Africanus, the self-promoting Roman military tribune. Finally, O&#x2019;Connell reveals how Cannae&#x2019;s legend has inspired and haunted military leaders ever since, and the lessons it teaches for our own wars.</p></p><p>Robert L. O&#x2019;Connell has worked as a senior analyst at the National Ground Intelligence Center, as a contributing editor to MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History, and most recently as a visiting professor at the Naval Postgraduate School.

It was exactly the same inviting panorama Hannibal had shown his half-starved, half-frozen, thoroughly discouraged army seventy-three years before, exhorting them to stay the course on what would prove to be an amazing path of conquest. Quite probably enough bits and pieces of that weary host remained visible for Polybius to be sure he was in the right spot; a certitude denied future chroniclers, and giving rise to one of ancient history&#x2019;s most enduring and futile controversies: Where exactly did Hannibal cross the Alps?1 Polybius, for his part, was free to concentrate on questions he found more important. It was his aim&#x2014;an endeavor that would eventually fill forty books&#x2014;to explain to his fellow Greeks how a hitherto obscure city-state on the Italian peninsula had come to dominate, virtually in the course of a lifetime, the entire Mediterranean world. But if Rome stood at center stage in Polybius&#x2019;s inquiry, Hannibal and Carthage were his foils. Each in their own way had nearly put an end to Rome&#x2019;s ambitions. Both by this time were dead, obliterated by Rome, but it was the challenges they had posed and the disasters they had inflicted that Polybius found most compelling. For no matter how bad things had gotten, Rome had always responded, had picked itself up out of the dustbin of history and soldiered on. And it was in defeat more than victory that Polybius saw the essence of Rome&#x2019;s greatness.<br><br>It never got worse than Cannae. On August 2, 216 b.c., a terrible apocalyptic day in southern Italy, 120,000 men engaged in what amounted to a mass knife fight. At the end of the fight, at least forty-eight thousand Romans lay dead or dying, lying in pools of their own blood and vomit and feces, killed in the most intimate and terrible ways, their limbs hacked off, their faces and thoraxes and abdomens punctured and mangled. This was Cannae, an event celebrated and studied as Hannibal&#x2019;s paragon by future practitioners of the military arts, the apotheosis of the decisive victory. Rome, on the other hand, lost&#x2014;suffering on that one day more battle deaths than the United States during the entire course of the war in Vietnam, suffering more dead soldiers than any other army on any single day of combat in the entire course of Western military history. Worse yet, Cannae came at the end of a string of savage defeats engineered by the same Hannibal, Rome&#x2019;s nemesis destined to prey on Italy for another thirteen years and defeat army after army and kill general after general. Yet none of this would plumb the depths reached on that awful afternoon in August.<br><br>It has been argued that Polybius, aware of Cannae&#x2019;s enormous symbolic import, deliberately structured his history so as to make the battle appear as the absolute low point in Rome&#x2019;s fortunes, thereby exaggerating its significance.2 Yet, not only do sheer numbers argue the contrary, but also Rome on this day lost a significant portion of its leadership class, between a quarter and a third of the senate, the members of which had been anxious to be present at what had been assumed would be a great victory. Instead it was a debacle by any measure, so much so that a case can be made that Cannae was even more critical than Polybius believed, in retrospect a true pivot point in Roman history. Arguably the events of this August day either initiated or accelerated trends destined to push Rome from municipality to empire, from republican oligarchy to autocracy, from militia to professional army, from a realm of freeholders to a dominion of slaves and estates. And the talisman of all of this change was one lucky survivor, a young mili- tary tribune named Publius Cornelius Scipio,* known to history as Africanus. For at the end of many more years of fighting, Rome still would need a general and an army good enough to defeat Hannibal, and Scipio Africanus, with the help of what remained of the battlefield&#x2019;s disgraced refugees, would answer the call and in the process set all else in motion.<br><br>* Typical Roman names of the late republican period had three elements: a praenomen, or given name (in this case Publius), chosen from a limited list and having no family connotation; a nomen, referring to the gens or clan name (Cornelii); and, finally, the cognomen, or family within the clan (Scipio).</p><h2>Late for the Wedding (Lavinia Lake and Tobias March)</h2><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Amanda Quick returns with a thrilling new venture into romance and mystery, featuring the most unusual, highly compatible--undeniably combustible--pairing of Tobias March and his mesmerizing partner, Lavinia Lake.<br><br>An invitation to a country house party at Beaumont Castle provides a perfect solution to Tobias and Lavinia&#x2019;s most exasperating challenge: how to escape the chaos of London for a remote, relaxing--and above all romantic--retreat from prying eyes and wagging tongues. But the lovers&#x2019; plans are foiled when their first cozy interlude of the weekend is disrupted by the appearance of a stunning woman from Tobias&#x2019;s past. Aspasia Gray&#x2019;s beauty is as haunting as her connection to Tobias. Her long-deceased fianc� was a friend of his--in addition to being an eccentric assassin. The mysterious nature of the bond between Tobias and Aspasia makes Lavinia more than a little uncomfortable. Especially as her first encounter with Aspasia occurs when she finds her in Tobias&#x2019;s bedchamber...<br><br>It seems Aspasia is seeking protection--and solace--after receiving an ominous message that eerily recalls the past. Suddenly the obstacles standing betweenTobias and Lavinia appear greater than just a little London gossip--and far more deadly.When events at the castle suggest someone is imitating the dead killer&#x2019;s methods, the team of Lake and March fervently pursue the investigation--and each other--as their leads take them from Society&#x2019;s most elegant haunts--and most discreet hideaways--to London&#x2019;s shadiest backstreets. As their relationship heats up, so does the intrigue. Soon Lavinia will have to employ all her talents to flummox the scoundrel who so rudely interrupted her rendezvous. And then she and Tobias can get back to more pleasurable affairs.</p><p>Amanda Quick, a pseudonym for Jayne Ann Krentz, is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling, award-winning author of contemporary and historical romances.

The cobra diadem that graced her long, elaborately braided black wig gleamed in the light of a nearby wall sconce. Wry amusement lit her dark eyes. &#x201c;It has been a long time, has it not? May I come in?&#x201d;<br><br>It had, in fact, been three years since he had last seen Aspasia Gray, but she had changed very little. She was still a stunningly beautiful woman with a classical profile that was well-suited to her guise as the queen of Egypt. He knew that her real hair was a deep, rich brown. Her tall, elegantly proportioned figure was displayed to advantage in a pale green gown trimmed with gold embroidery.<br><br>The last thing he wanted to do tonight was renew old acquaintances, Tobias March thought. But the sight of Aspasia Gray had definitely shattered the mood. Memories from that very dark time three years ago crashed over him with the force of storm-driven waves.<br><br>He collected his wits with an effort and quickly surveyed the darkened hallway behind Aspasia. There was no sign of Lavinia. Maybe, if he acted swiftly, he would be able to rid himself of his unwelcome visitor before his evening was entirely ruined.<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;d better come in.&#x201d; Reluctantly, he stepped back.<br><br>&#x201c;You have not changed, sir,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;Still as gracious as ever, I see.&#x201d;<br><br>She entered the firelit room with a soft rustle of silken skirts and a whisper of exotic perfume. He closed the door and turned to face her.<br><br>He had not noticed any Cleopatras at the costume ball earlier in the evening, but that was not surprising. Beaumont Castle was a huge, sprawling monstrosity of a house, and tonight it was crammed with people. He had been interested in only one particular guest.<br><br>The invitation to the house party had come through the auspices of Lord Vale. Tobias&#x2019;s first, automatic inclination had been to decline the offer. He had little interest in such affairs. House parties, in particular, struck him as tedious at best, albeit his experience of them was limited.<br><br>But then Vale had reminded him of the one singular attraction of a properly organized country-house party.<br><br>Yes, there are the lengthy, boring breakfasts and the frivolous conversations and the silly games, but bear in mind this vastly important, highly relevant point: you and Mrs. Lake will each be provided with a private bedchamber. Furthermore, no one will pay the least attention to which of those bedchambers you decide to occupy at night. Indeed, the true objective of a well-planned house party is to provide ample opportunities of that sort.<br><br>The reminder of the true nature of a large house party had struck Tobias with the force of a lightning bolt. When Vale, who had no intention of attending the Beaumont affair, graciously offered the use of one of his private carriages for the journey, Tobias had felt himself inspired.<br><br>He had been surprised, not to say greatly relieved, when Lavinia agreed to the plan with very little fuss. He suspected that her enthusiasm was generated in large part because she viewed the house party as an excellent opportunity to fish for new business. But he refused to allow that fact to depress his spirits. For the first time in their acquaintance, they would enjoy the luxury of being able to spend the better portion of not one but two entire nights in the cozy warmth and privacy of a real bed.<br><br>The prospect had been dazzling. For once there would be no need to sneak about in remote sections of the park or make do with the desk in Lavinia&#x2019;s little study. For three glorious days he would not be obliged to rely on the benevolent graces of Lavinia&#x2019;s housekeeper, who could sometimes be persuaded to take herself off to shop for currants when he came to call.<br><br>He certainly savored the all-too-brief encounters alone with Lavinia in town, but those occasions&#x2014;stimulating though they were&#x2014;tended to be rushed and occasionally nerve-racking. The weather had a nasty habit of delivering rain on afternoons when he chose the park for a tryst, and one never knew when Lavinia&#x2019;s niece, Emeline, might select an inopportune moment to return home.<br><br>There was also the unpredictable nature of the business in which he and Lavinia were engaged. When one offered one&#x2019;s services to persons who wished to commission private inquiries and investigations, one never knew when a client might knock on the door.<br><br>He looked at Aspasia. &#x201c;What the devil are you doing here? I thought you were in Paris.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am well aware that you have a tendency to be blunt to the point of rudeness on occasion, Tobias. But surely I deserve a warmer welcome from you. It is not as though I am only a casual acquaintance, after all.&#x201d;<br><br>She was right, he thought. The two of them were forever linked by the events of the past and by a dead man named Zachary Elland.<br><br>&#x201c;My apologies,&#x201d; he said quietly, &#x201c;but the truth is, you have caught me very much by surprise. I did not see you this afternoon when the other guests descended on the castle, nor did I notice you at the costume ball tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I arrived quite late, after the evening festivities had commenced. I saw you at the ball, but you were preoccupied with your little redheaded friend.&#x201d; Aspasia stripped off her gloves with languid grace and held her hands out to the fire. &#x201c;Who on earth is she, Tobias? I would not have said that she was your type.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Her name is Mrs. Lake.&#x201d; He did not bother to conceal the edge to his words.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, I see.&#x201d; She looked down into the flames. &#x201c;You are lovers.&#x201d; It was a statement, not a question.<br><br>&#x201c;We are also business partners,&#x201d; he said evenly. &#x201c;On occasion.&#x201d;<br><br>Aspasia glanced at him, fine brows lifted in a faintly quizzical expression. &#x201c;I do not understand. Do you refer to some financial dealings in which the two of you are engaged?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In a manner of speaking. Mrs. Lake and I both make our livings in the same fashion. She takes commissions for private inquiries, just as I do. We investigate certain cases together.&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled fleetingly. &#x201c;I suppose the private-inquiry business is a step up from being a spy, but surely it is not nearly as respectable as your previous career as a man of business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I find it suits my temperament.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will not ask how your partner made her living before she went into this odd profession.&#x201d;<br><br>Enough was enough, he thought. There were limits to one&#x2019;s obligations to old acquaintances. &#x201c;Aspasia, tell me why you are here. I have plans for the remainder of the night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Plans that no doubt include Mrs. Lake.&#x201d; Aspasia sounded genuinely apologetic. &#x201c;I truly am sorry, Tobias. Please believe me when I tell you that I would not have come to your bedchamber at this hour had it not been extremely urgent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can this matter wait until morning?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid not.&#x201d; She turned away from the fire and walked slowly toward him.<br><br>Aspasia was a woman of the world. He knew that she was well-schooled in the fine social art of concealing her private sentiments and feelings. But now he glimpsed a disturbing shift in the shadows beneath her cool veneer. He had seen that same emotion often enough in others to recognize it instantly. Aspasia Gray was afraid.<br><br>&#x201c;What is wrong?&#x201d; he asked, somewhat more gently this time.<br><br>She sighed. &#x201c;I did not come here to spend a few days rusticating in the country. As of last night, I had no intention whatsoever of accepting the invitation to Beaumont&#x2019;s house party. Indeed, I sent my regrets some weeks ago. But things changed. I am here now because I followed you, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>He glanced at his pocket watch lying on the dressing table and saw that it was nearly one o&#x2019;clock in the morning. The house had settled down for the night. In a few minutes Lavinia would knock on his door. He very much wanted to get rid of Aspasia before that happened.<br><br>&#x201c;Why the devil did you chase all this way after me?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a six-hour drive from Town.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I had no choice. This morning I went straight to your address in Slate Street but you had already departed. Your man informed me that you had left for Beaumont Castle and would be gone for several days. Fortunately, I remembered that the invitation mentioned the costume ball. I managed to find this wig and a mask at the last minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You received an invitation to this affair?&#x201d; he asked, curiosity stirring.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course.&#x201d; Aspasia brushed that aside. &#x201c;Lady Beaumont sends invitations to everyone in Society. She delights in entertaining. It has been her passion for years, and Lord Beaumont is only too happy to indulge her.&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone in Society certainly did not include Lavinia or himself, he reflected. They managed to hang around on the fringes of the polite world thanks to connections with some wealthy, powerful former clients such as Vale and Mrs. Dove, but that association did not automatically qualify them to be placed on any hostess&#x2019;s regular guest list.<br><br>Aspasia&#x2019;s pedigree, on the other hand, was impeccable. She was the last of her line, and she controlled a substantial inheritance that she had received from her father. At seventeen she had been briefly married to a man some forty years her senior. His death six months after the nuptials had left her with an additional income. Tobias calculated that she was now twenty-eight. The combination of beauty, breeding, and money made her an extremely attractive addition to any guest list. It was not at all surprising that she had received an invitation to Beaumont Castle.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised the housekeeper was able to find a bedchamber for you on such short notice,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I thought the castle was filled to the rafters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is quite crowded. But when I arrived and made it plain that there had been &#x2018;a mistake with the invitations,&#x2019; the butler and housekeeper consulted together. They managed to find a very pleasant room for me just down the hall. I suspect that they arranged to move someone of lesser consequence to a less desirable location.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me what this is about, Aspasia.&#x201d;<br><br>She began to pace back and forth in front of the hearth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure where to start. I returned from Paris last month and took a house in Town. Naturally I had intended to call upon you in due course after I was settled.&#x201d;<br><br>He watched her face very closely and decided that he did not entirely believe that last statement. He was quite certain that, if she&#x2019;d had a choice in the matter, she would have been content to avoid him indefinitely. He understood. She would always associate him with the tragic events of three years past.<br><br>&#x201c;What changed your mind?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Her expression did not alter, but her elegant bare shoulders stiffened with tension. It would, he reflected, take a great deal to rattle Aspasia&#x2019;s nerves.<br><br>&#x201c;Something happened this morning,&#x201d; she said, gazing into the fire. &#x201c;Something quite unsettling. I could not think of anything else to do but to consult with you immediately, Tobias.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suggest you come straight to the point,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Very well, but I fear you will not credit what I have to say if I do not show you what was left on my front step early this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>She opened a tiny, beaded reticule and removed a small object wrapped in a linen handkerchief. She offered it to him on the palm of her hand.<br><br>He plucked the small parcel from her fingers and carried it across the room to examine it in the light of the candle. There he untied the handkerchief and let the cloth fall away.<br><br>He looked at the ring that had been revealed and felt the hair lift on the back of his neck.<br><br>&#x201c;Hell&#x2019;s teeth,&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br>Aspasia said nothing. She folded her arms beneath her breasts and waited, eyes shadowed.<br><br>He studied the ring more closely. The band was set with black stones. The darkly glittering gems framed a small gold coffin. He used the tip of one finger to raise the lid.<br><br>A tiny, exquisitely detailed white skull grinned up at him from inside the miniature sarcophagus.<br><br>He angled the ring to read the Latin inscription on the inside of the lid, translating the ancient warning silently to himself. Death comes.<br><br>He met Aspasia&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;It is an old memento-mori ring.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She hugged herself more tightly.<br><br>&#x201c;You said it was left on your doorstep?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My housekeeper found it. The ring was inside a small box covered in black velvet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Was there a note? A message of some kind?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Just that damned ring.&#x201d; She shuddered, no longer bothering to conceal her disquiet. &#x201c;You see now why I went to such lengths to find you tonight?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is impossible,&#x201d; he said flatly. &#x201c;Zachary Elland is dead, Aspasia. We both saw the body.&#x201d;<br><br>She closed her eyes briefly in pain and then looked at him very steadily. &#x201c;You do not need to remind me.&#x201d;<br><br>The old guilt slammed through him. &#x201c;Of course not. My apologies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Afterward,&#x201d; she said slowly, &#x201c;you told me you&#x2019;d heard rumors of another man who once made a profession of murder, just as Zachary had done, a killer who used the same ghastly signature.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Calm yourself, Aspasia.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I recall you told me that he was never caught and that there was never any proof of murder in the first place because the deaths always appeared accidental or natural.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aspasia&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s still out there, Tobias. Maybe&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Listen closely,&#x201d; he said in a tone that finally succeeded in silencing her. &#x201c;The original Memento-Mori Man, if he ever actually existed, would be quite elderly by now. Dead, most likely. Those rumors dated from decades back. Crackenburne and some of his companions heard them years ago when they themselves were young men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They eventually concluded that the tale of a professional killer for hire was never anything other than just that, a grisly legend. It was fed by rumors among servants who gossiped in the taverns and told tall tales to their friends. Zachary no doubt took pleasure in invoking the old stories because it suited his sense of melodrama. You know how he thrived on excitement.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course.&#x201d; The room was warm, but she rubbed her arms as though she felt a chill. &#x201c;He craved thrills and drama the way some are addicted to opium.&#x201d; She hesitated. &#x201c;He no doubt enjoyed re-creating the legend of the Memento-Mori Man. Now it would appear that someone else has the same taste for melodrama.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tobias, I do not mind telling you that I am quite frightened.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Obviously someone else knows about Zachary Elland and his connection to you.&#x201d; He contemplated the miniature skull in the gold coffin. &#x201c;Are you sure there was no note?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am positive.&#x201d; She stared bleakly at the ring. &#x201c;He left that death&#x2019;s- head on my step to terrify me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why would he do that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not know.&#x201d; A visible shiver went through her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking about that question all day. Indeed, I&#x2019;ve thought of little else.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;What if . . . what if whoever left that ring blames me for Zachary&#x2019;s death and seeks some sort of crazed revenge?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Zachary took his own life when he realized that I was about to have him brought up on charges of murder.

Okay, clever enough. But the story quickly becomes more refreshingly and unexpectedly mysterious with each turn of the page, and I realized that Fesperman has achieved something remarkable here. He&#x2019;s turned the spy novel on its head, while paying homage to the genre, and at the same time giving us an unlikely protagonist who discovers that he&#x2019;s lived his entire life in a world &#x201c;where fact and fiction were virtually indistinguishable.&#x201d; Innovative and evocative. --<i>Neal Thompson</i>Dan Fesperman&#x2019;s travels as a writer have taken him to thirty countries and three war zones. <i>Lie in the Dark </i>won the Crime Writers&#x2019; Association of Britain&#x2019;s John Creasey Memorial Dagger Award for best first crime novel, <i>The Small Boat of Great Sorrows</i> won their Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award for best thriller, and <i>The Prisoner of Guant�namo </i>won the Dashiell Hammett Award from the International Association of Crime Writers.

Geek girl Elle Wittimer lives and breathes&nbsp;<i>Starfield</i>, the classic sci-fi series she grew up watching&nbsp;with her late father. So when she sees a cosplay contest for a new&nbsp;Starfield&nbsp;movie, she has to&nbsp;enter. The prize? An invitation to the ExcelsiCon Cosplay Ball, and a meet-and-greet with&nbsp;the actor slated to play Federation Prince Carmindor in the reboot. With savings from her&nbsp;gig at the Magic Pumpkin food truck (and her dad&#x2019;s old costume), Elle&#x2019;s determined to win...unless her stepsisters get there first.<br> &nbsp;<br> Teen actor Darien Freeman used to live for cons&#x2014;before he was famous. Now they&#x2019;re nothing&nbsp;but autographs and awkward meet-and-greets. Playing Carmindor is all he&#x2019;s ever wanted, but&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Starfield&nbsp;</i>fandom has written him off as just another dumb heartthrob. As ExcelsiCon draws&nbsp;near, Darien feels more and more like a fake&#x2014;until he meets a girl who shows him otherwise.</p><p><b>Ashley Poston&nbsp;</b>is the author of&nbsp;<i>Geekerella</i>&nbsp;(Quirk Books, 2017) and&nbsp;<i>Heart of Iron&nbsp;</i>(HarperCollins, 2018). She loves dread pirates, moving castles, and starry night skies. When not lost in a book, she's lost in real life, searching for her next great adventure.The stepmonster is at it again.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Raffles, discount coupons, and magazine sweepstakes lay strewn&nbsp;across the kitchen table. My stepmom sits straight-backed in one of&nbsp;the creaky wooden chairs, delicately cutting out another coupon, dyed&nbsp;blonde hair piled on top of her head in perfect ringlets, lipstick the color&nbsp;of men&#x2019;s heartblood. Her white blouse is spotless, her dark pencil skirt&nbsp;neatly ironed. She must have a meeting with a potential client today.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sweetie, a little faster this morning.&#x201d; She snaps her fingers for me&nbsp;to hurry up.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shuffle over to the counter and pry open the coffee tin. The smell is&nbsp;strong and cheap&#x2014;the only kind I was raised on. Which is all the better,&nbsp;seeing as we can&#x2019;t afford expensive coffee, although I know that never&nbsp;stops the stepmonster from ordering her double-shot dirty chai soy latte&nbsp;no whip every morning and charging it to one of her dozens of credit&nbsp;cards.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Catherine&#x2014;my stepmom&#x2014;picks up another magazine to cut. &#x201c;No&nbsp;carbs this morning. I&#x2019;m feeling bloated and I have a meeting with a couple&nbsp;this afternoon. Big wedding plans. She&#x2019;s a debutante, if you could&nbsp;believe that!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Charleston? I can believe it. Everyone&#x2019;s either a debutante,&nbsp;a Daughter of the Confederacy, or a politician&#x2019;s kid&#x2014;Thornhill or&nbsp;Fishburne or Van Noy or Pickney or a handful of old Charlestonian<br> names. And I couldn&#x2019;t care less.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I dump two scoops of coffee into the machine&#x2014;plus an extra one&nbsp;for good measure. It feels like a three-scoop kind of day. Maybe adding&nbsp;more caffeine to their morning will get my stepmother and the twins out&nbsp;before nine. That&#x2019;s not too much to wish for, is it?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I glance up at the clock on the microwave. 8:24 a.m. Unless the&nbsp;twins start moving at warp speed, I&#x2019;ll be cutting it real close. I say a&nbsp;silent prayer to the Lord of Light or Q or whoever is listening: <i>Please,&nbsp;for</i> once, <i>let the stepmonster and the twins leave the house on time</i>.&nbsp;<i>Starfield</i> history will be made today at 9 a.m. sharp on <i>Hello, America</i>,&nbsp;and I won&#x2019;t miss it. I <i>refuse</i>. Finally, after years of delays and director&nbsp;changes and distribution snafus, the movie is happening&#x2014;a reboot, but&nbsp;beggars can&#x2019;t be choosers&#x2014;and today they&#x2019;re making the long-awaited&nbsp;announcement of the official film platform. The lead actors, the plot,&nbsp;everything. I&#x2019;ve missed <i>Starfield</i>&nbsp;marathons and midnight rereleases of&nbsp;the final episode in theaters and convention appearances because of&nbsp;Catherine and the twins, but I&#x2019;m not missing <i>this</i>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They want to say their vows under the magnolia trees at Boone&nbsp;Hall Plantation,&#x201d; Catherine goes on. &#x201c;You know, ever since Ryan Reynolds&nbsp;and his wife got married there, that place is always booked.&#x201d;&nbsp;Catherine is a wedding planner. I&#x2019;ve watched her spend entire weekends&nbsp;hand-sewing sequins onto table toppers and hand-pressing invitations&nbsp;at the print shop downtown. The way she plans a venue, down&nbsp;to the type of cloth on the tables and the color of flowers in the vases,&nbsp;making every wedding look like a magical land of unicorns. You&#x2019;d think&nbsp;she does it because of her own happily-ever-after cut short, but that&#x2019;s a&nbsp;lie. She wants her weddings in <i>Vogue</i>&nbsp;and <i>InStyle</i>, the kind you Instagram&nbsp;and Pinterest a hundred times over. She wants the renown of it,&nbsp;and she&#x2019;s sunk all of Dad&#x2019;s life insurance payout into her business. Well,&nbsp;her business and everything she claims is &#x201c;essential&#x201d; to her &#x201c;image.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I want to at least <i>look</i>&nbsp;like I shop at Tiffany&#x2019;s,&#x201d; she says, talking&nbsp;more to herself than to me.<br>It&#x2019;s the same spiel again and again. How she used to shop at Tiffany&#x2019;s.&nbsp;How she used to attend galas at Boone Hall Plantation. How she used&nbsp;to be happily married with two wonderful daughters. She never mentions&nbsp;me, her stepdaughter.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Catherine finishes cutting her coupon with a sigh. &#x201c;But that was all&nbsp;<i>before</i>. Before your father left me and the twins here in this dreadful&nbsp;little house.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&nbsp;And there it is</i>. Like it&#x2019;s my fault that she&#x2019;s blown all her savings.&nbsp;Like it&#x2019;s <i>Dad&#x2019;s</i> fault. I take out Dad&#x2019;s <i>Starfield</i>&nbsp; mug&#x2014;the only thing left&nbsp;of his in our house&#x2014;and pour myself a cup of coffee.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Outside, the neighbor&#x2019;s dog begins to bark at a passing track-suited&nbsp;jogger. We live on the outskirts of the famous historical district, the house&nbsp;not quite old enough to be a tourist attraction but not new enough to&nbsp;be renovated&#x2014;not that we could afford it anyway. Two streets over and&nbsp;you run into the College of Charleston. Our house was one of the last&nbsp;ones left after Hurricane Hugo decimated the coast of South Carolina&nbsp;before I was born. The house has its leaks, but all good and old things&nbsp;do. I&#x2019;ve lived here my whole life. I don&#x2019;t know anything else.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Catherine absolutely hates it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The coffee smell is rich and nutty. I take a sip, and I almost melt. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;heaven. Catherine clears her throat, and I pour coffee into her favorite&nbsp;mug: white with pink flowers. Two sugars (the only sweetness she&nbsp;splurges on each day), lightly stirred, with three ice cubes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She takes it without even looking up from her magazine. And then,&nbsp;when the neighbor dog lets out a sharp howl, she sets down her cup.&nbsp;&#x201c;You would <i>think</i>&nbsp;dogs would learn when to shut up. Giorgio has&nbsp;enough on his plate without that dog barking.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Catherine likes to pretend she&#x2019;s on a first-name basis with everyone,&nbsp;but especially people she deems important. Mr. Ramirez&#x2014;Giorgio&#x2014;is a&nbsp;banker, which means he has a lot of money, which means he&#x2019;s an influential&nbsp;part of the country club, which means he&#x2019;s important.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;If it doesn&#x2019;t shut up soon,&#x201d; she goes on in that cool, detached voice&nbsp;of hers, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll muzzle it myself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;His name&#x2019;s Franco,&#x201d; I remind her. &#x201c;And he doesn&#x2019;t like being tied up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, we all must get used to disappointment,&#x201d; she replies, and&nbsp;takes another sip of coffee. Her blood-colored lips turn into a scowl&nbsp;and she shoves the mug back at me. &#x201c;Too bitter. Try again.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Begrudgingly, I put in another cube of ice to water it down. She takes&nbsp;the coffee and tries another sip. It must be sufficiently soulless, because&nbsp;she sets it down beside her stack of coupons and goes back to scanning&nbsp;the gossip column in her magazine.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Well?</i>&#x201d; She prods.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hesitate, looking from her coffee to her, wondering if I&#x2019;ve forgotten&nbsp;something. I&#x2019;ve been doing this for seven years&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m&nbsp;missing anything.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Outside, the dog gives a pitiful howl. <i>Oh.</i><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She raises a pencil-thin eyebrow. &#x201c;How am I supposed to have&nbsp;a calm morning with <i>that </i>racket?&#x201d; she goes on in that overworked,&nbsp;all-knowing voice of hers. &#x201c;If Robin was still here . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I glance back at her. Open my mouth. Begin to say that I miss Dad&nbsp;too. I want him here too&#x2014;but something stops me. Or I stop myself.&nbsp;I blame it on the lack of coffee. One sip doesn&#x2019;t give you the insta-courage&nbsp;a cup does. Besides, I&#x2019;m not trying to make Catherine mad. I&#x2019;m&nbsp;trying to get her caffeinated, placated, and <i>out the door.</i><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She flips the page in her magazine and picks up the scissors again to&nbsp;cut out a coupon for a winter coat. It&#x2019;s June. In South Carolina.&nbsp;But then Catherine clears her throat. &#x201c;Danielle, <i>do something</i> to get<br> that mutt to quiet down.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Now,</i>&#x201d; Catherine says, flicking her hand for me to hurry up.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sure, <i>my queen</i>,&#x201d; I mutter under my breath. While Catherine puts&nbsp;down her coupons and picks up an article about Jessica Stone&#x2019;s latest&nbsp;red carpet look, I slip last night&#x2019;s steak tips out of the fridge and hurry&nbsp;through the back door.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Poor Franco sits in the mud outside of his doghouse, thumping his&nbsp;tail in a puddle. He looks at me through the broken slat in the fence, a&nbsp;muddy brown Dachshund in a dirty red collar. It rained last night and&nbsp;his doghouse flooded, just like I told Mr. Ramirez&#x2014;sorry, <i>Giorgio</i>&#x2014;it&nbsp;would.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Ramirez brought Franco home a few weeks after he married&nbsp;his second ex-wife, I guess as a dry run for having a kid. But since his&nbsp;divorce a few years ago, he pretty much lives at work, so Franco is this&nbsp;forgotten idea that never panned out, with the flooded doghouse to&nbsp;prove it. At least the poor Frank can float.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slide the container through the slat and rub the dog behind the&nbsp;ears, slathering my fingertips in mud. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good boy, yes you are!&nbsp;Once I save up enough, I&#x2019;ll spring the both of us out of here. Whatcha&nbsp;think of that, copilot?&#x201d; His tail pat-pats excitedly in the mud. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll even&nbsp;get us matching sunglasses. The whole nine yards.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Franco&#x2019;s tongue lolls out of the side of his mouth in agreement.&nbsp;Maybe they don&#x2019;t even make doggy sunglasses, but for a while I&#x2019;ve had&nbsp;this picture in my head: me and Franco crammed into a beat-up car,&nbsp;heading out on the only highway out of town&#x2014;wearing sunglasses, of&nbsp;course&#x2014;and headed straight for L.A.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ever since I can remember, my fingers have itched to make things.&nbsp;To write. I have filled journals, finished fanfics, escaped again and again&nbsp;into the pages of someone else&#x2019;s life. If Dad was right&#x2014;if I could do&nbsp;anything, be anyone &#x2014;I would make a show like <i>Starfield</i> and tell other&nbsp;weird kids that they aren&#x2019;t alone. And after next year&#x2014;my senior year&#x2014;I&#x2019;m going to do it. Or start to. Study screenwriting. Write scripts. I&#x2019;ve&nbsp;already got a portfolio, kind of. Right now I satisfy my need to write by&nbsp;blogging on my site <i>Rebelgunner,</i>&nbsp;where I cover the one thing I know&nbsp;for certain: <i>Starfield</i>. That and the money I&#x2019;m scraping together from my job at the food truck are gonna be my ticket out of here. One day.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Danielle!&#x201d; my stepmom screeches from the kitchen window.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I push the steak tips under the fence and Franco dives headfirst into&nbsp;the bowl.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Maybe in another universe, boy,&#x201d; I whisper. &#x201c;Because for now, my&nbsp;home is here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This place is too full of memories to leave, even if I wanted to. Dad&nbsp;technically left the house to me, but Catherine&#x2019;s in charge of it while I&#x2019;m&nbsp;still a minor. So until then&#x2014;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Danielle!</i>&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Until then I&#x2019;m here with my stepmother and her daughters.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;All right! Coming!&#x201d; With one last scratch behind Frank&#x2019;s ear, I say&nbsp;goodbye, make a mental note to return later for the dish, and dart back&nbsp;to the kitchen.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Girls!&#x201d; Catherine calls again, slinging a Gucci purse over her shoulder.&nbsp;&#x201c;Hurry up or you&#x2019;ll be late for Mr. Craig&#x2019;s lesson! Girls? <i>Girls</i>! You&nbsp;better be awake or so help me I&#x2019;ll . . .&#x201d; Her footsteps thud up to their&nbsp;room and I glance at the clock. 8:36. There&#x2019;s no <i>way</i> they&#x2019;ll be out of&nbsp;here in time. Not unless I speed things along.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Begrudgingly, I assemble kale and strawberries and almond milk to fix the twins&#x2019; morning smoothies. Catherine has, of course, left her&nbsp;magazine splayed on the counter, so Darien Freeman&#x2019;s face is grinning&nbsp;up at me. My lips curl into a sneer. There were rumors that he had&nbsp;signed on to the new <i>Starfield&nbsp;</i>remake, but that&#x2019;s about as big of a joke&nbsp;as saying Carmindor will be played by a pug riding a skateboard. You&nbsp;don&#x2019;t put a soap opera star in charge of an entire galaxy.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ugh. I press blend and try not to think about it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upstairs, there are muffled thumps as Catherine drags the twins out&nbsp;of bed. This happens every morning, like clockwork.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My summertime morning routine goes like this: Wake up&#x2014;coffee,&nbsp;extra scoop for Mondays. Catherine stoops over the morning papers,&nbsp;cutting out coupons. Lingers too long on purses and pretty dresses.&nbsp;Says something passive-aggressive about her old life. Orders me to fix&nbsp;breakfast. Instead, I feed the Frank. Catherine goes upstairs to yell at&nbsp;the twins for &#x201c;forgetting&#x201d; to set their alarms. I still don&#x2019;t fix breakfast.&nbsp;Ten minutes later, the twins are fighting over the shower, and Catherine&nbsp;reminds me that she is the one with the deed to the house, <i>Danielle</i>,&nbsp;and unless I want her to cash in this place for a luxury condo &#x2014;as if&nbsp;this house would ever get that much&#x2014;I had better fix breakfast. So I&nbsp;blend up their Grinch vomit, the twins grab their matching tumblers,&nbsp;and Catherine shoves them out the door for tennis lessons.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rest of my day is never much better. I&#x2019;ll be five minutes late&nbsp;to work, but my coworker Sage&#x2014;the food-truck owner&#x2019;s daughter&#x2014;is&nbsp;too engrossed in her Harajuku fashion magazines to even notice. Then&nbsp;it&#x2019;s eight hours in the Magic Pumpkin, doling out healthy food-truck&nbsp;fritters to bankers in tight business suits and soccer moms with babies&nbsp;bouncing on their hips. Then I&#x2019;m elbowing my way through the supermarket&nbsp;armed with coupons that make the cashier roll her eyes when I&nbsp;get in line (everyone hates coupons). Then home again for &#x201c;family dinner,&#x201d;&nbsp;made by me. Cue the twins&#x2019; mean comments on my cooking, then&nbsp;their disappearance upstairs to film a beauty vlog about the perfect cat&nbsp;eye or best eyeshadow pairing with ruby lips or whatever. Then dishes,&nbsp;leftovers, one last check on Franco, and bed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, sorta. Then late-night reruns of <i>Starfield</i>&nbsp;on my Dad&#x2019;s boxy TV&nbsp;in the corner of my room. Maybe I write a blog post about the episode,&nbsp;if I&#x2019;m feeling inspired. Check all my Stargunner fansites for news. I fall&nbsp;asleep to the Federation Prince&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;<i>Look to the stars. Aim. Ignite.</i>&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next morning I wake up, and we do everything all over again.&nbsp;But this time&#x2014;plot twist!&#x2014;I get to work on time. Maybe Sage actually&nbsp;talks to me for once. Maybe the twins are nice. Maybe someone stuffs&nbsp;two airplane tickets to L.A. into the tip jar. Maybe I write a love-letter&nbsp;to episode 43 instead of criticizing the integrity of the characters as the&nbsp;colony blows up. Maybe I dream about Dad.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blender growls as though it&#x2019;s in pain. I let it rest and shake the&nbsp;kale smoothie into two separate tumblers, nervously glancing at the&nbsp;...</p><h2>How Judges Think (Pims - Polity Immigration and Society Series)</h2><p><p>A distinguished and experienced appellate court judge, Richard A. Posner offers in this new book a unique and, to orthodox legal thinkers, a startling perspective on how judges and justices decide cases. When conventional legal materials enable judges to ascertain the true facts of a case and apply clear pre-existing legal rules to them, Posner argues, they do so straightforwardly; that is the domain of legalist reasoning. However, in non-routine cases, the conventional materials run out and judges are on their own, navigating uncharted seas with equipment consisting of experience, emotions, and often unconscious beliefs. In doing so, they take on a legislative role, though one that is confined by internal and external constraints, such as professional ethics, opinions of respected colleagues, and limitations imposed by other branches of government on freewheeling judicial discretion. Occasional legislators, judges are motivated by political considerations in a broad and sometimes a narrow sense of that term. In that open area, most American judges are legal pragmatists. Legal pragmatism is forward-looking and policy-based. It focuses on the consequences of a decision in both the short and the long term, rather than on its antecedent logic. Legal pragmatism so understood is really just a form of ordinary practical reasoning, rather than some special kind of legal reasoning. </p><p>Supreme Court justices are uniquely free from the constraints on ordinary judges and uniquely tempted to engage in legislative forms of adjudication. More than any other court, the Supreme Court is best understood as a political court.</p></p><p>From the book:Ivan Karamazov said that if God does not exist everything is permitted, and traditional legal thinkers are likely to say that if legalism (legal formalism, orthodox legal reasoning, a &#34;government of laws not men,&#34; the &#34;rule of law&#34; as celebrated in the loftiest &#34;Law Day&#34; rhetoric, and so forth) does not exist everything is permitted to judges--so watch out! Legalism does exist, and so not everything is permitted. But its kingdom has shrunk and greyed to the point where today it is largely limited to routine cases, and so a great deal is permitted to judges. Just how much is permitted and how they use their freedom are the principal concerns of this book.. . .I am struck by how unrealistic are the conceptions of the judge held by most people, including practicing lawyers and eminent law professors, who have never been judges--and even by some judges. This unrealism is due to a variety of things, including the different perspectives of the different branches of the legal profession--including also a certain want of imagination. It is also due to the fact that most judges are cagey, even coy, in discussing what they do. They tend to parrot an official line about the judicial process (how rule-bound it is), and often to believe it, though it does not describe their actual practices. This book parts the curtain a bit.Richard A. Posner is Circuit Judge, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School.</p><h2>The Nevada Test Site</h2><p><p><b>A photographic study of the land that served as the main testing site for American nuclear devices for four decades</b></p><p>More nuclear bombs have been detonated in America than in any other country in the world. Between 1951 and 1992, the Nevada National Security Test Site was the primary location for these activities, withstanding more than a thousand nuclear tests that left swaths of the American Southwest resembling the moon. In <i>The Nevada Test Site</i>, renowned American photographer Emmet Gowin (b. 1941) presents staggering aerial photographs of this powerfully evocative place.</p><p>Gowin remains the only photographer granted official and sustained access to the Nevada Test Site. For this book, he has revisited his original negatives, made in 1996 and 1997, and fully three-quarters of the images featured here have never been published before. These images show blast areas where sand has been transformed to glass, valleys pockmarked with hundreds of craters, trenches that protected soldiers from blasts, areas used to bury radioactive waste, and debris left behind following tests conducted as deep as five thousand feet below the Earth&#x2019;s surface. Together, these stunning, unsettling views unveil environmental travesties on a grand scale. An essay by Gowin delves into the history of his work at the site, including his decade-long efforts to secure entry, the photographic equipment and techniques employed, and what the images mean to him today.</p><p>With a foreword by photographer and writer Robert Adams, <i>The Nevada Test Site</i> stands as a testament to the harms we inflict on our surroundings, the importance of bearing witness, and the possibilities for aesthetic redemption and a more hopeful future.</p></p><p>A powerful photographic study of the landscape that was the primary testing location of American nuclear devices for over four decades<b>Emmet Gowin</b> is emeritus professor of photography at Princeton University.

One of her early projects was the Harlem-based Friendship House, which attracted a young Thomas Merton. Later, with her second husband, Eddie Doherty, she established Madonna House in Combermere, Ontario. Though Roman Catholic, Catherine drew on her Russian roots and helped popularize the concept of Poustinia (the Russian word for desert)a place where a person meets God through solitude, prayer, and fasting. These writings, drawn from 25 books, highlight her distinctive spirituality, with its emphasis on the presence of God, the practice of prayer, a love for the church, and a deep apprehension of the social dimension of the gospel.</p><p></p><h2>The Book of Secrets of Albertus Magnus: Of the Virtues of Herbs, Stones, and Certain Beasts, Also a Book of the Marvels of the World</h2><p><p>In order to attract readers, it was not uncommon for magical texts of the 16th century to take on the name of a notable figure.

Such is the case with The Book of Secrets of Albertus Magnus, whose secrets are, in fact, a compilation from a number of sources by an anonymous author who was, according to editors Best and Brightman, probably one of Albertus Magnus' followers. Though it "...pretends to be a product of his experimental school among the Dominicans at Cologne", it has a more colloquial voice than that of Albertus Magnus. It more accurately portrays the popular magical literature available in the 16th century than the erudite works directly attributable to Albertus Magnus.<p>The secrets revealed are divided into five distinct parts: <br>-- Of the Virtues of Herbs -- Describes 23 herbs, their magical, astrological, and medicinal properties, as well as preparations and recipes.<br>-- Of the Virtues of Stones -- Presents 45 entries from the lapidary of Albertus Magnus, Mineralia, listed by their particular effect or specific magical property.<br>-- Of the Virtues of Beasts -- Lists 18 animals, their natural powers, and their use in performing magical feats.<br>-- Of the Planets -- A treatise on the hours of the day governed by the various planets, and a discussion of their astrological qualities.<br>-- The Marvels of the World -- A theoretical discussion of magic emphasizing the necessity of experiment, followed by a large number of recipes from various sources.</p><p>This edition features an in-depth introduction by scholars Michael R. Best and Frank H. Brightman outlining the history of the text, its historical/cultural context, and the variant manuscripts sourced. It is aninvaluable study for students of the history of Western magic, and those interested in the evolution of printed works through the ages.

I&#x2019;ll hit him if I want.&#x201d; Mrs. Lucille Templeton had grabbed her seven-year-old son, Griffin, by the arm as he tried to escape after &#x201c;accidentally&#x201d; dropping a plate of beans into her lap.<br><br>&#x201c;Look at my dress!&#x201d; Mrs. Templeton wailed, staring down at a green-velvet-trimmed traveling dress that was clearly ruined. She tightened her grip until the boy grimaced and said, &#x201c;This fiendish brat spilled that plate on purpose. He deserves the whipping he&#x2019;s going to get.&#x201d;<br><br>Hetty balled her fists and took three steps to put herself toe-to-toe with Mrs. Templeton. &#x201c;You will beat that child over my dead body. Let him go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hah!&#x201d; Mrs. Templeton snorted. Nevertheless, she loosened her grip, and Griffin jerked free and fled. He disappeared behind the Conestoga wagon in which they&#x2019;d all been traveling from Cheyenne, in the Wyoming Territory, to Butte, in the Montana Territory, where Mrs. Templeton was destined to become a mail-order bride.<br><br>The hodgepodge Templeton family included the widow Templeton, her nine-year-old daughter, Grace, and her seven-year-old son, Griffin. Hetty had trouble imagining how Mrs. Templeton had produced a daughter as kind as Grace, although she had no doubt how she&#x2019;d spawned a hellion like Griffin.<br><br>Nevertheless, not one of the three Templetons looked like any of the others or seemed anywhere near their professed ages.<br><br>Mrs. Templeton, with her dyed blond hair, muddy brown eyes, and substantial figure, looked considerably older than twenty-eight.<br><br>Grace was plump, had flyaway red hair and green eyes, and was already sprouting small buds on her chest, which told Hetty she was more likely twelve or thirteen than the nine she professed to be.<br><br>Her brother, Griffin, was a skinny stripling with dark brown eyes and tangled black hair that made Hetty itch to take a brush to it. Hetty figured he&#x2019;d last seen the age of seven three or four years ago.<br><br>No less odd was the short, slender, but very strong young Chinese man who was their guide, protector, and driver, Mr. Lin Bao, who said he&#x2019;d come to America ten years ago to work on the transcontinental railroad. Hetty had learned that the Chinese put their family name first, so Mr. Lin&#x2019;s first name was Bao, which he&#x2019;d told her rhymed with cow. Mr. Lin now worked for the man who would become Mrs. Templeton&#x2019;s husband, Mr. Karl Norwood.<br><br>&#x201c;If I&#x2019;d had my way, Miss High-and-Mighty,&#x201d; Mrs. Templeton muttered as she lifted her skirts to dump beans from its folds, &#x201c;we would have left you to rot in that wagon where we found you.&#x201d;<br><br>Hetty had no doubt of that. She&#x2019;d never met a lazier or more selfish person in her life than Lucille Templeton. It was appalling that she owed this woman her life.<br><br>Mrs. Templeton had forced Mr. Lin to stop near the apparently abandoned Conestoga wagon because she&#x2019;d wanted to scavenge whatever remained inside, but someone had already looted the wagon. All she&#x2019;d discovered was Hetty, dehydrated, weak from loss of blood, and with a wound that had become infected from the arrow deeply embedded in her shoulder.<br><br>If not for Mrs. Templeton&#x2019;s avarice, Hetty would be dead.<br><br>Although, honestly, it was Mr. Lin&#x2019;s doctoring that had kept her alive. He&#x2019;d used mysterious medicines from the Orient to bring Hetty back to life over the past seven weeks as they&#x2019;d traveled north. Mrs. Templeton claimed to be a nurse, but she didn&#x2019;t seem to know much about caring for anyone. Hetty shot a quick look at the young Chinaman, who was sitting quietly beside the fire smoking a long, curved white clay pipe.<br><br>&#x201c;If it had been up to you, Lucy,&#x201d; a young female voice accused, &#x201c;you would have left Hetty in that wagon to die.&#x201d;<br><br>Hetty hadn&#x2019;t seen Grace approaching from the opposite side of the campfire, but she&#x2019;d seen the girl defend her brother from their mother&#x2019;s slaps often enough to know that where Griffin was, Grace was never far behind.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of this, Grace,&#x201d; Hetty said, knowing that Mrs. Templeton was still angry enough to lash out at her daughter.<br><br>Her warning came too late. Mrs. Templeton reached out her arm like a lizard&#x2019;s tongue, grabbed a handful of Grace&#x2019;s tumbled red curls, and yanked hard. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one to blame for this. I never should have brought the two of you along.&#x201d;<br><br>Grace shot a fearful look in Hetty&#x2019;s direction.<br><br>Hetty couldn&#x2019;t imagine having a mother who wished she&#x2019;d left her children behind. A mother who felt free to slap faces and yank hair. A mother who considered her children a nuisance. No wonder Grace looked so scared.<br><br>Hetty&#x2019;s heart went out to the girl. Hetty&#x2019;s own wonderful, loving parents had been lost three years ago in the Great Chicago Fire, when Mrs. O&#x2019;Leary&#x2019;s cow had kicked over a lantern and burned down most of the city, including the Wentworth family mansion and her father&#x2019;s bank.<br><br>Overnight, Hetty had gone from being the pampered daughter of wealthy parents to being an orphan stuck in the Chicago Institute for Orphaned Children. Her uncle, Stephen Wentworth, had left Hetty and her three sisters and two brothers at the orphanage even after they&#x2019;d begged him to rescue them from the cruelty of the headmistress, Miss Iris Birch.<br><br>Miss Birch, like Mrs. Templeton, seemed to find joy in brutality against those weaker than herself. Every infraction at the Institute had been punished with three&#x2014;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky it&#x2019;s only three!&#x201d; Miss Birch was fond of saying&#x2014;vicious strokes of a birch rod.<br><br>Hetty forced her thoughts away from her five siblings, who were all lost . . . or dead . . . but certainly gone. She couldn&#x2019;t do anything to help them. But she could help Grace.<br><br>&#x201c;What I said about Griffin goes for Grace, too,&#x201d; Hetty said. &#x201c;Let her go.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Templeton twisted Grace&#x2019;s hair until the girl whimpered and stood on tiptoes to avoid the pain. &#x201c;This is my kid. I&#x2019;ll do with her as I like.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not while I&#x2019;m here, you won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Hetty obeyed a sudden impulse, and her balled fist struck Mrs. Templeton in the nose.<br><br>&#x201c;Ow!&#x201d; Mrs. Templeton released Grace and grabbed her bloodied nose. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll pay for that!&#x201d;<br><br>Instead of running like Griffin had, Grace stood and watched with anxious eyes. &#x201c;Please, Lucy,&#x201d; the girl pleaded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Griffin&#x2019;s sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up, you ungrateful whelp!&#x201d; Mrs. Templeton snarled.<br><br>That was another strange thing about the Templeton family. Hetty couldn&#x2019;t imagine calling her own mother by her first name, yet both children called their mother &#x201c;Lucy.&#x201d; Nor could she imagine any mother calling her daughter an &#x201c;ungrateful whelp.&#x201d;<br><br>Hetty should have known better than to think Mrs. Templeton wouldn&#x2019;t strike back. A moment later she felt nails claw their way across her face, narrowly missing her left eye. One of the scratches across her brow bled profusely, blurring Hetty&#x2019;s vision on that side, so she almost missed seeing Mrs. Templeton bend to pick up a heavy dead branch.<br><br>&#x201c;Lucy, don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; Grace cried. And then, to Hetty, &#x201c;Look out!&#x201d;<br><br>As Mrs. Templeton swung the unwieldy weapon Hetty bent backward but then lost her balance and fell into a clump of buffalo grass. Hetty made the mistake of trying to push herself upright with her injured shoulder and yelped in pain. Even after seven weeks, it wasn&#x2019;t healed enough to support her. She was stuck on the ground, a sitting duck the next time Mrs. Templeton swiped at her with that heavy branch.<br><br>Mrs. Templeton must have realized Hetty&#x2019;s pre- dicament, because she uttered a shout of triumph. However, the ponderous weight of the branch, as it continued its sweeping arc, had dragged her side- ways. Instead of letting go to regain her balance, she held on to the branch, and her momentum forced her several steps backward.<br><br>Hetty heard Mr. Lin yelling something behind her, but she was too busy trying to avoid being brained by the tree branch to pay attention. She heard Mrs. Templeton cry out and wondered if Grace had somehow intervened to save her.<br><br>Hetty looked up in time to see Mrs. Templeton&#x2019;s arms flailing as she tripped backward over a large stone. She finally let go of the branch, which flew several feet upward before it began falling, falling, disappearing from sight before ever hitting the ground.<br><br>As Hetty struggled to her feet, she realized at last what Mr. Lin had been shouting. &#x201c;Be careful!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;The cliff!&#x201d;<br><br>She got one last look at Mrs. Templeton&#x2019;s face in the firelight&#x2014;a ghoulish mask of fury&#x2014;before the woman fell backward out of sight.<br><br>Her shrill scream seemed to go on endlessly. Then it stopped.<br><br>Hetty dashed with Grace toward the edge of the hundred-foot rock cliff that had been visible in the daylight when they&#x2019;d camped, but which had disappeared beyond the light of the campfire after dark. She felt sick with grief and regret. She&#x2019;d only wanted to protect Grace and Griffin. Instead she&#x2019;d made them orphans. She couldn&#x2019;t do anything right! Mr. Lin should have let her die.<br><br>&#x201c;Watch out!&#x201d; Hetty gasped as she put a hand across Grace&#x2019;s waist to keep the girl away from the edge. She could see nothing in the blackness below.<br><br>Grace kept repeating, &#x201c;Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; Griffin called out. &#x201c;Did the witch hurt herself?&#x201d;<br><br>Grace turned on her brother angrily as he appeared in the light of the campfire and said, &#x201c;The witch is dead.&#x201d;<br><br>Hetty stared at the two children, dismayed at what they were saying about the woman who&#x2019;d borne them. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; she asked Grace. &#x201c;Your mother has just died a ghastly death.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She wasn&#x2019;t our ma!&#x201d; Griffin retorted.<br><br>&#x201c;Griffin,&#x201d; Grace warned. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say another word.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no reason to lie anymore. Lucy&#x2019;s dead. We&#x2019;re DOOMED.&#x201d;<br><br>Hetty remembered her twin sister, Hannah, using that precise term, DOOMED, when their eldest sister, Miranda, had turned eighteen and could no longer remain at the orphanage. Miranda was the one who&#x2019;d protected them from Miss Birch&#x2019;s terrible temper. Without her, they were DOOMED to suffer under the iron discipline of the horrible headmistress.<br><br>In the end, Miranda had stolen away, along with their two younger brothers, Nick and Harry, to become a mail-order bride in Texas. At least, Hetty hoped that was what had happened. The three sisters left behind&#x2014;Hetty, her identical twin Hannah, and Josie&#x2014;had never heard from Miranda again.<br><br>When Miranda had failed to contact them, they&#x2019;d taken desperate measures to escape Miss Birch. Hannah had followed Miranda&#x2019;s lead and become the mail-order bride of an Irishman, Mr. McMurtry, and Hannah, Hetty, and Josie had journeyed west with him to the Wyoming Territory.<br><br>That trip had ended in a disaster that was all her fault. Because of her behavior, they&#x2019;d been forced to leave the safety of the wagon train. Their lives had quickly unraveled. Mr. McMurtry had died of cholera, Hetty had been sorely wounded in an Indian attack, Josie had been taken captive by the savages, and Hannah had gone for help and never returned.<br><br>By the time Hetty had come to her senses, after weeks and weeks of being nursed back to health by Mr. Lin, they&#x2019;d been closer to Butte than Cheyenne. She&#x2019;d been forced to continue the journey to the Montana Territory. Once she got to Butte, Hetty planned to find some way to get back to Cheyenne, locate Hannah, if she was still alive, and begin a search for Josie.<br><br>Now she&#x2019;d caused another disaster! What was wrong with her? Why did she always do exactly the wrong thing? How would she ever make amends for the wrong she&#x2019;d done to these two poor orphaned children?<br><br>It suddenly dawned on her what Griffin had blurted. She wasn&#x2019;t our ma! Hetty&#x2019;s brow knit in confusion. So what were the two children doing with Mrs. Templeton?<br><br>She suddenly understood so many things that had seemed strange about Mrs. Templeton&#x2019;s behavior toward her supposed children. About Griffin&#x2019;s pranks, which often had Mrs. Templeton as their victim. About Grace&#x2019;s wariness around her pretend mother. About the disparities in ages and appearances of the entire fake family. But how had the three of them ended up together on this journey to Butte?<br><br>Hetty turned to Grace and Griffin, who were now standing beside each other. She crossed her arms over her chest because she could feel her body beginning to tremble, and it was all she could think of to do to keep herself from flying into a million pieces.<br><br>Mrs. Templeton was dead on the rocks at the bottom of the cliff. Hetty was at least partly responsible for someone dying. Again.<br><br>She forced her mind away from memories of the calamity she&#x2019;d caused on the journey west. There was nothing she could do to change the past. She closed her eyes to shut out the awful vision of two men fighting because of her, and the vivid blue eyes of the man she&#x2019;d loved as he lay dying in her arms. When she opened them again, she said to the two children, &#x201c;Is there something you&#x2019;d like to tell me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Templeton worked upstairs at the saloon where we were living,&#x201d; Griffin said. &#x201c;Before our mom died, she used to work there, too, and some of the ladies made sure we had a place to sleep and food to eat. But Grace was getting older, and they wanted her to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Griffin, that&#x2019;s enough,&#x201d; Grace interrupted.<br><br>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; Griffin continued, &#x201c;Mr. Norwood&#x2019;s advertisement for a mail-order bride said that he&#x2019;d consider a widow with children, so Grace went to Lucy with this crazy idea that we could all get out of there if Lucy became this guy Norwood&#x2019;s mail-order bride.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Mrs. Templeton went along?&#x201d; Hetty asked.<br><br>Grace grimaced. &#x201c;As soon as I agreed to pay her, she did.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You paid her to bring you along and she treated you that badly?&#x201d; Hetty said.<br><br>&#x201c;Why do you think I dumped those beans in her lap?&#x201d; Griffin said.<br><br>&#x201c;I wrote all the letters to Mr. Norwood,&#x201d; Grace said. &#x201c;But Lucy insisted that I tell him she was twenty-eight, so Griffin and I had to pretend to be younger, too. I&#x2019;m thirteen. I&#x2019;ll be fourteen in a couple of months.&#x201d;<br><br>Hetty turned to Griffin and asked, &#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be ten in the spring.&#x201d;<br><br>Hetty glanced at Mr. Lin, who was listening to this confession, and wondered what he was thinking. His dark eyes remained inscrutable.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re DOOMED, all right,&#x201d; Grace said.<br><br>Hetty watched tears pool in Grace&#x2019;s eyes before they slid onto her freckled cheeks. Her heart went out to the two children.<br><br>Grace glanced at her brother and said, &#x201c;I can always get work at a saloon in Butte.&#x201d;<br><br>Griffin&#x2019;s eyes narrowed, and his mouth flattened to a hard line. &#x201c;Not that kind of work. Not if I have anything to say about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What other choice do we have?&#x201d; Grace said quietly.<br><br>It took Hetty a moment to realize what kind of work Grace was considering. At seventeen, Hetty was still naive enough, even after hearing the escapades of a girl at the orphanage who&#x2019;d previously taken a lover, to be shocked. &#x201c;There must be a better alternative,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Not unless we go to some orphanage,&#x201d; Griffin replied bitterly. &#x201c;We ended up in one right after our ma died, but we ran away. We&#x2019;ve been hiding out at the saloon ever since. I&#x2019;m never going back. I&#x2019;ll starve first.&#x201d;<br><br>Hetty shuddered. Grace working in a brothel? Grace and Griffin at the mercy of some cruel headmistress like Miss Birch? &#x201c;There has to be a way for the two of you to avoid either of those choices.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There is way,&#x201d; Mr. Lin said.<br><br>Hetty, Grace, and Griffin all turned to find the Chinaman tapping out the contents of his long clay pipe.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you suggest?&#x201d; Hetty asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I think you be mail-order bride,&#x201d; Mr. Lin said. &#x201c;Two kid...</p><h2>The General vs. the President: MacArthur and Truman at the Brink of Nuclear War</h2><p><b>From master storyteller and historian H. W. Brands comes the riveting story of how President Harry Truman and General Douglas MacArthur squared off to decide America's future in the aftermath of World War II.</b> <br><br>At the height of the Korean War, President Harry S. Truman committed a gaffe that sent shock waves around the world. When asked by a reporter about the possible use of atomic weapons in response to China's entry into the war, Truman replied testily, "The military commander in the field will have charge of the use of the weapons, as he always has." This suggested that General Douglas MacArthur, the willful, fearless, and highly decorated commander of the American and U.N. forces, had his finger on the nuclear trigger. A correction quickly followed, but the damage was done; two visions for America's path forward were clearly in opposition, and one man would have to make way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Truman was one of the most unpopular presidents in American history. Heir to a struggling economy, a ruined Europe, and increasing tension with the Soviet Union, on no issue was the path ahead clear and easy. General MacArthur, by contrast, was incredibly popular, as untouchable as any officer has ever been in America. The lessons he drew from World War II were absolute: appeasement leads to disaster and a showdown with the communists was inevitable--the sooner the better. In the nuclear era, when the Soviets, too, had the bomb, the specter of a catastrophic third World War lurked menacingly close on the horizon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contest of wills between these two titanic characters unfolds against the turbulent backdrop of a faraway war and terrors conjured at home by Joseph McCarthy. From the drama of Stalin's blockade of West Berlin to the daring landing of MacArthur's forces at Inchon to the shocking entrance of China into the war,<i> The General and the President</i> vividly evokes the making of a new American era.</p><p>H. W. BRANDS holds the Jack S. Blanton Sr. Chair in History at the University of Texas at Austin. A <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author, he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in biography for <i>The First American</i> and <i>Traitor to His Class</i>.The General vs. the President<br>PROLOGUE<br><br>December 1950<br><br>Clement Attlee didn&#x2019;t like appearing flustered. The British prime minister&#x2019;s predecessor, Winston Churchill, was the one who indulged in dramatics: the speeches about blood, sweat and tears; finest hours; Iron Curtains. Attlee had evicted Churchill from 10&nbsp;Downing Street at the end of World War&nbsp;II in no small part because the British people wanted less drama and more predictability. Yet the sudden news from America had even Attlee sweating. The House of Commons was debating the optimal course of British foreign policy when the BBC brought word that Harry Truman was brandishing the atom bomb against China. This itself horrified the British lawmakers. The American president was the only person in history who had ordered the use of the monstrous weapon, and a man who had atom-bombed Japan might, without additional scruple, do the same to China. But there was a crucial new element, these five years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that made the prospect still more appalling. The Russians had the bomb, too, and were China&#x2019;s allies. A nuclear war in 1950 would not be one-sided. <br><br> And there was something else, something that pushed the alarm level in Britain far past that of any previous Cold War crisis. By Truman&#x2019;s own statement, the decision on use of the atom bomb rested with the American field commander in Korea, Douglas MacArthur. Attlee and many others in Britain could think of no one more frightening than MacArthur to have control of the bomb. MacArthur was brilliant, brave&nbsp;and imaginative&#x2014;even his critics granted that. But the general had isolated himself so long in Asia, and surrounded himself with such sycophants, that he had lost all perspective. He suffered from an extreme version of the theater commander&#x2019;s habit of thinking his own region the pivot of any conflict. During World War&nbsp;II MacArthur had behaved as though fascism would triumph or be defeated according to the outcome of battle in the Pacific; in the Cold War he contended that communism would win or lose depending on what happened in Asia. He had chafed at the communist victory in China&#x2019;s civil war, now a year past. The outbreak of fighting in Korea five months ago had given him his chance to engage the communists, and the sudden entry of China into the conflict, just a week ago, had raised the stakes dramatically. MacArthur seemed to relish the opportunity to smash the communists, using whatever weapons were available. And now Truman was making the ultimate weapon available.<br><br> The House of Commons burst into an uproar on hearing the word from Washington. Members of Attlee&#x2019;s Labour party, already convinced that the Americans were reckless and MacArthur was a maniac, threatened a mutiny against their prime minister for his support of the American-led effort in Korea. To quell the uprising, Attlee announced that he would travel to America. He implied that he would talk sense and restraint into Truman. But he knew, and they knew, that this was more than he could guarantee. The mutiny hung fire, stemmed for the moment yet hardly vanquished.<br><br> Britain&#x2019;s alarm was broadly shared. None of the countries that had supported the United States in the defense of South Korea had bargained on the fighting there triggering World War&nbsp;III. The French distrusted MacArthur even more than the British did, and made no secret of the fact. The French National Assembly called for immediate negotiations to defuse the crisis in Korea. French premier Ren� Pleven hastened to London to meet Attlee before the British prime minister left for Washington, and to lend his voice to those insisting that the Americans refrain from rash moves. Fear of the bomb united rightist and leftist parties in Italy, where protesters branded Truman a war criminal. West German officials, on the front line of the Cold War in Europe, refused to comment publicly but privately said America&#x2019;s use of the bomb against China would almost certainly compel a Russian response, probably against&nbsp;them. India&#x2019;s government, which earlier had conveyed a warning from Beijing that the Chinese would enter the Korean conflict if MacArthur insisted on sending U.S. troops to the Korean-Chinese border&#x2014;a warning MacArthur had airily dismissed&#x2014;now predicted that a resort to greater force would provoke a cataclysm. Pope Pius XII urged Catholics to pray that the world might be spared.<br><br> Americans shuddered as well. &#x201c;Is it World War&nbsp;III?&#x201d; asked the New York Times. The paper didn&#x2019;t say yes, but it couldn&#x2019;t say no. New Yorkers flooded the civil-defense offices of the city and state with demands to know where they should seek refuge when the Russian bombs began falling. The state director of civil defense tried to calm things but only made them worse when he said his office was operating &#x201c;on the basis that an atomic or other attack could take place at any time.&#x201d; The response in other cities and states was much the same.&nbsp;<br><br> Members of Congress displayed caution about criticizing the president for standing up to the communists; none wanted to get into the crosshairs of Joseph McCarthy, at the peak of his red-baiting power. But several took pains to assert that the pertinent legislation gave authority over the use of the bomb to the president alone, not to any general. Nonpoliticians were less leery. Clergy and educators implored Truman to refrain from the terrible step he seemed to be contemplating. Frederick Nolde, speaking for the World Council of Churches, declared, &#x201c;We would veritably be playing into the hands of those who want to pin upon us the tangible responsibility for starting a world war.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>If the world was alarmed, Harry Truman was livid. And he blamed Douglas MacArthur for getting him into this mess. In his five years as president, Truman had tolerated repeated slights and affronts from MacArthur: the general&#x2019;s habit of making pronouncements on matters beyond his military responsibilities, his failure to return to America to brief the government on the U.S. occupation of Japan, his campaigning for president in 1948 without bothering to resign his command. Truman had suppressed his anger, lest a public row between the president and the general threaten the precarious stability of the Far East. When MacArthur had refused to travel more than half a day from his headquarters in Tokyo to discuss the war in Korea, Truman had undertaken the long&nbsp;journey to Wake Island. There he heard the general state with utter selfassurance that the Chinese would never dare to enter the Korean fighting. If they did, they would be obliterated.<br><br> A month later the Chinese entered the war. And they proceeded to manhandle MacArthur&#x2019;s army. Truman was stunned and outraged. How could MacArthur not have seen this coming? Had his arrogance simply blinded him?<br><br> MacArthur&#x2019;s horrendous misjudgment had put Truman in an impossible position. Since 1945 the president had been walking a knife-edge of decision between appeasement and war: between yielding to communist pressure and tipping the planet into a new world conflict. In 1946 a stern warning had sufficed to keep the Kremlin from grabbing Iran. In 1947 a stronger dose of American power, in the form of military aid to Greece and Turkey, had preserved the Balkans from a communist takeover. A massive airlift in 1948 had kept Berlin free. The North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 made clear to Moscow that an attack on any of America&#x2019;s allies would be met with the full force of America&#x2019;s arsenal. Billions of dollars of Marshall Plan money continued to pour into Europe to bolster democracy there.&nbsp;<br><br> The North Korean attack on South Korea in June&nbsp;1950 proved that the communists never rested. Truman had responded with measured force, enough to secure South Korea yet not so much as to bring the Soviets into the conflict. But then MacArthur&#x2019;s recklessness had provoked the Chinese to enter the fight. The Soviets, linked to the Chinese by a military pact, and as opportunistic as ever, wouldn&#x2019;t miss a chance to jump the United States where America&#x2019;s alliances were most vulnerable, should the Asian war escalate further. And further escalation was exactly what MacArthur was demanding.&nbsp;<br><br> The knife-edge that Truman had been walking suddenly terminated above an abyss. He couldn&#x2019;t go forward without risking a nuclear World War&nbsp;III. He couldn&#x2019;t retreat without undermining the morale of all who looked to America for leadership of the forces resisting communism. MacArthur had drastically narrowed the president&#x2019;s options, and the general had the gall to complain that <i>his </i>hands were being tied.&nbsp;<br><br> Reporters had heard of MacArthur&#x2019;s complaints; they knew they had a story. They asked Truman for a response. What measures would he authorize the general to employ to fend off the Chinese?&nbsp;<br><br> Truman didn&#x2019;t want to answer this question, not least because he&nbsp;hadn&#x2019;t decided. Anyway, as a poker player he knew not to tip his hand. But as a Democratic president harassed by Republicans for softness on communism, he judged he had to say something. &#x201c;We will take whatever steps are necessary,&#x201d; he replied.<br><br> &#x201c;Will that include the atomic bomb?&#x201d; a reporter asked. <br> &#x201c;That includes every weapon we have.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Does that mean that there is active consideration of the use of the atomic bomb?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;There has always been active consideration of its use.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> This was huge news. Never had the president spoken so openly about using the bomb. Another reporter wanted to be sure he had heard Truman correctly. &#x201c;Did we understand you clearly that the use of the atomic bomb is under active consideration?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Always has been,&#x201d; Truman said curtly. &#x201c;It is one of our weapons.&#x201d; <br> How would the decision on use be made? <br> &#x201c;The military commander in the field will have charge of the use of the weapons, as he always has.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> This was even bigger news. MacArthur&#x2019;s finger was on the nuclear trigger. The reporters scrambled to file their stories. The shock waves rolled around the world.&nbsp;<br><br> As the extent of the alarm echoed back to Washington, Truman&#x2019;s advisers urged him to let the White House issue a clarification. Truman agreed, but grudgingly, for he prided himself on plain speaking. The clarification stated that use of the atom bomb had been under consideration since the start of hostilities in Korea; whenever the United States went to war, all weapons were considered. As to who would make the basic, strategic decision to use the bomb, that would be the president. Tactical choices about where and when the bomb would be used would be left to the military commander in the field.&nbsp;<br><br> The clarification didn&#x2019;t alleviate the alarm, for it didn&#x2019;t materially revise Truman&#x2019;s own words. The president was considering the use of the bomb, and MacArthur would determine the time and place.&nbsp;<br><br> Truman cursed his bad luck, and he cursed MacArthur. The last thing he wanted was to have to use atomic weapons. He claimed not to have lost sleep over the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but no one takes the deaths of a hundred thousand civilians lightly. He hoped not to have to make such a decision again. And this time the consequences would be far more terrible. World War&nbsp;II had ended with atomic bombings; World War&nbsp;III would begin with them. But he couldn&#x2019;t back down. The Chinese were watching. The Russians were watching. Americans were watching. The world was watching.<br><br> Now Attlee was coming. Truman hated being on the spot like this: having to explain that he wasn&#x2019;t intending to start another world war, yet having to avoid seeming fearful or reluctant to oppose the communists.<br><br> And it was MacArthur&#x2019;s doing. Truman couldn&#x2019;t decide whether the general was the damnedest fool in the army, which had its share of fools, or the canniest political operator he had ever tangled with. Truman had to admit that MacArthur had outmaneuvered him, placing him on the brink of a broader war against China, when that was the last place he wanted to be.&nbsp;<br>Douglas MacArthur, sitting calmly in his office on the top floor of the Dai Ichi Building in central Tokyo, wondered what all the fuss was about. MacArthur disdained politicians as a class, whether prime ministers or presidents. He believed politicians lacked the knowledge or nerve to make the decisions national safety required. He had dealt with presidents for decades and not found one who didn&#x2019;t falter at the moment of truth or put partisan self-interest ahead of the country&#x2019;s interest. This was why he had kept his distance from Washington. His deliberate exile was in its sixteenth year; he had resisted repeated requests from the White House to come home, and he would continue to resist them as long as he could. His work was more important than what consumed the office seekers. He had guided the Philippines to independence; he had defeated imperial Japan and was building a republican Japan. For the last five months he had been holding the line against communism in Korea.&nbsp;<br><br> He was on the verge of doing much more. Since 1945 freedom had been in retreat; communism had captured Eastern Europe and then China. It had come close to engulfing all of Korea. But there he had made a stand and subsequently sent the communists reeling. His success was no thanks to Washington, where the president and his advisers had fretted and quavered until he&#x2014;Douglas MacArthur&#x2014;had taken the responsibility upon himself and plunged ahead.&nbsp;<br><br> In short order he accomplished what no one else&#x2014;no president, no general&#x2014;had accomplished during the Cold War, rolling back the red&nbsp;tide and reclaiming territory previously lost to communism. And once more he defied the fretters, who didn&#x2019;t want to upset the communists of China. He again assumed responsibility and ordered his troops to the Korean border with China.<br><br> It was then that the Chinese entered the war, causing everyone in Washington&#x2014;and London and several other world capitals, apparently&#x2014;to run for cover. MacArthur took the new development in stride. He admitted that he hadn&#x2019;t expected such large numbers of Chinese to appear in Korea. But what the politicians interpreted as a mauling he accounted the cost of springing the Chinese trap. He had foiled the communists&#x2019; plan to annihilate his army; he was retreating but stretching their supply lines and rendering them vulnerable to his airpower. He now had the communists just where he wanted them.&nbsp;<br><br> All that was required was nerve in Washington. He didn&#x2019;t expect it to appear unprompted. Harry Truman was no less the political animal than Franklin Roosevelt, whom MacArthur had had to educate during World War&nbsp;II. Truman might be educated, too. The general took encouragement from the president&#x2019;s remarks about the atom bomb; maybe he <i>did </i>see what was at stake in Korea. Would he follow through? Could he stand up to Attlee and the others who would beseech him to step back? Time would tell.&nbsp;<br><br> Was it World War&nbsp;III? Not yet. But if a lifetime at arms had taught Douglas MacArthur anything, it was that an inordinate fear of war was the surest guarantor of war. Hadn&#x2019;t the democracies learned anything from Hitler? Appeasement of the fascists had caused World War&nbsp; II; appeasement of the communists wou...</p><h2>The Ten Minute Moment</h2><p>What happens when attention is focused on Attention for one week?

Born in 1971, Nihei made his debut in the comics world as the winner of the 1995 <i>Afternoon Magazine</i> Four Seasons Award for short stories. He then briefly worked as an assistant to veteran comicker Tsutomu Takahashi before making his break-through hit <i>BLAME!</i> (published by Tokyopop). <br><br>The <i>BLAME!</i> franchise was so well received worldwide, that it inspired an animated mini-series and eventually drew the attention of Marvel Comics in the US. Nihei would later go on to draw Wolverine (X-Men) and HALO comics for Marvel to great fanfare. An architectural student, Nihei's early work were mainly wordless, relying on visuals and backgrounds to tell their stories.

She has two major interests: Roman/Saxon Britain and the Golden Age of Piracy-the early eighteenth century.</p><p><b><i>April 1002-Canterbury</i></b></p> <p>Emma was uncertain whether it was a growing need to visit the privy or the remaining queasiness of <i>mal de mer</i>, seasickness, that was making her feel so utterly dreadful. Or was it the man assessing her with narrowed eyes from where he stood at the top of the steps? A man she had never seen until this moment, who was four and thirty years to her three and ten, spoke a language she barely understood, and who, from the morrow, was to be her wedded husband. Did he approve of what he saw? Her sun-gold hair, blue eyes, and fair skin? Maybe, but Emma was uncomfortably aware that he was more probably thinking her nose was too large, her chin too pointed, and her bosoms not yet firm and rounded.</p> <p>Her eldest sister had laughed when Emma confided that this �thelred of England might be disappointed with his bride. "Pleasure him in bed, <i>ma ch�rie</i>," had been the answer. "In bed, no husband will remain disappointed for long." Here in England, Emma remained unconvinced.</p> <p>Hiding her discomfort as well as she could, she stared at this King's sun-weathered face. His blond hair, curling to his shoulders, had silver streaks running through it. His moustache trailed down each side of his mouth into a beard flecked with grey hair. He looked so old!</p> <p>Her long fingers, with their bitten, uneven nails, rested with a slight tremble on her brother's left hand. Unlike her, Richard appeared unperturbed as they ascended the steps leading up to the great open-swung doors of Canterbury Cathedral. But why would he not be at ease? It was not he, after all, who was to wed a stranger and be crowned as England's anointed Queen.</p> <p>She was aware that Richard of Normandy had agreed to this marriage of alliance for reasons of his own gain. He ruled Normandy and his brood of sisters with an iron will that imaged their father's ruthless determination-their father Emma had adored; her brother, who thought only of his self-advancement and little else, she did not.</p> <p>The drizzling rain had eased as their Norman entourage had ridden through Canterbury's gates; the mist, hanging like ill-fitted curtaining across the Kent countryside had not deterred the common folk from running out of their hovels to inspect her. England and the English might not hold much liking for the Normans and their sea-roving Viking cousins, but still they had laughed and applauded as she passed by. They wanted peace, an end to the incessant <i>i-v�king </i>raiding and pirating, to the killing and bloodshed. If a union between England and Normandy was the way to achieve it, then God's good blessings be upon the happy couple. Whether this marriage would be of lasting benefit and achieve that ultimate aim no one yet knew. The Northmen, with their lust for plunder, were not easy to dissuade, and the substantial wealth of England was a potent lure. For a while, though, when Richard, in consequence of this wedding denied winter access to his Norman harbours, the raiders would search elsewhere for their ill-gotten gain or stay at home. Unless, of course, they elected to offer Richard a higher incentive than the one King �thelred of England had paid.</p> <p>If Emma minded being so blatantly used for political gain, it was of no consequence to anyone. Except to Emma herself. <i>What if I am not a pleasing wife? What if he does not like me? </i>The questions had tumbled round and around in Emma's mind these three months since being told of the arrangement, had haunted her by night and day. She knew she had to be wed; it was a woman's duty to be a wife, to bear sons. Either that or drown in the monotonous daily misery of the nunnery, but there would be no Abbess's veil for her. Her brother needed the alliances his sisters brought, the silver and the land. Normandy was a new young duchy with no family honour or pride to fall back upon, only the hope of a future, which Richard was too impatient to wait for. This, Emma had understood from the day their father died. Richard wanted all he could get, and he wanted it not tomorrow or next year, but now. One by one his sisters had been paired to noble marriages, but they were all so much older than Emma. She had not expected to be bargained away so soon.</p> <p>�thelred was stepping forward, reaching out to take her hand, a smile on his face, crow's-foot lines wrinkling at his eyes.</p> <p>She sank into a deep reverence, bending her head to hide the heat of crimson suddenly flushing into her cheeks. At her side, Richard snorted, disgruntled that she should be greeted before himself.</p> <p>He had not wanted to escort her to England. On that dreadful sea crossing he had vociferously balked at meeting face to face with this Englishman, King �thelred. "I do not trust a man who was involved in the murder of his own brother to gain the wearing of a crown," he had stated several times over. If these were his thoughts, then why, in the name of sweet Jesu, had he agreed to this marriage? Why was she here, feeling awkward and uncertain, fearing to look at the man who would soon be taking her innocence of maidenhood? <i>Non</i>, Richard had not wanted to come to England, but he <i>had </i>wanted to ensure that the agreed terms were honoured. <i>Dieu! </i>He needed the financial gain and the respectability, the prestige of having his youngest sister wed to one of the wealthiest Kings in all Europe.</p> <p>From somewhere Emma had to gather the courage and dignity to raise her head, smile at �thelred...She clung to the talisman of her mother's parting words: "No matter how ill, how frightened, or how angry you might be, child, censure your feelings. Smile. Hold your chin high, show only pride, nothing else. Fear and tears are to be kept private. You are to be crowned and anointed Queen of England. The wife and mother of Kings. Remember that." Emma took a breath, looked at the man who was to be her husband, and knew, instantly, that she disliked him.</p></p><h2>Angels, Demons &amp; Gods of the New Millennium</h2><p>A delightfully entertaining liberal arts education in Western Hermeticism with one of America&#39;s most knowledgeable and engaging authorities! Each chapter is a self-contained monograph on one of 7 topics critical tounderstanding modern magick.</p><p>One of the most widely respected members of the magic community, Lon Milo DuQuette is known for his ability to address the rather intimidating aspects of magick with a casual candor; he makes the subject accessible to the initiate while still holding the interest of the experienced reader. <i>Angels, Demons &amp; Gods of the New Millennium</i> is a collection of loosely connected essays surveying the state of magick in the face of the new millennium. It showcases DuQuette's knack for combining wit with profundity, producing chapters such as "Qabalah-Zen of the West" and "Demons Are Our Friends," while addressing contemporary topics such as initiations and the procession of the equinoxes.Lon Milo DuQuette has been involved with occult studies since the late 60s, and has become an acknowledged and widely recognized authority within the world of modern occultism.

"We enter the 21st century still carrying on our backs the prejudices and ways of thinking of countless past generations. What worked for them may or may not still be of use, so it is our job to make sure to save the tools that can help us and let go of the dead weight."</p></p><p>Daniele Bolelli is a writer, university professor and martial artist and the author of <i>50 Things You're Not Supposed to Know: Religion</i>. He is a history professor at Santa Monica College and California State University, Long Beach and is a regular contributor to several magazines both in Italy and in the United States. He lives in Los Angeles.<b>STARRED LIBRARY JOURNAL REVIEW:</b> This is one of the most refreshing, humorous, and radically honest books about practical and comparative religion this reviewer has ever come across. Bolelli (history, Santa Monica Coll. &amp; California State Univ., Long Beach; <i>50 Things You&#x2019;re Not Supposed to Know: Religion</i>), whose website declares, &#x201c;Answering hopelessness with a defiant smile and raised middle finger!&#x201d; offers a bold, passionate invitation to question everything we&#x2019;ve been taught, saying only that which remains relevant. Thus, Bolelli is a heretic in the classic sense of one who picks and chooses what to believe. However, this is not shallow New Age drivel; rather, it is a candid and ambitious investigation of the beliefs of major world religions, Eastern and Western, on a wide variety of topics including afterlife, gender roles, sex, and laughter. Throughout, Bolelli cheerfully and irreverently searches for meaningful answers buried among the spiritual relics of humanity. <b>VERDICT:</b> Highly recommended for all those who are not absolutely certain about the truth of their beliefs or lack of them. Likely to be enjoyed by those who do not take themselves too seriously." &#x2013;<b>Brian Sullivan</b>, Alfred Univ. Lib., NY<br><br>&#x201c;Daniele Bolelli's book is a joy to read. It is clearly written and engaging, filled with humor and thought provoking ideas. The questions he raises and the dialogue he creates is not only worthwhile but, I believe, essential. I am thrilled that he touches on the Bruce Lee legacy within these pages. I believe wholeheartedly that my father's legacy continues to survive today precisely because he tried to honestly express himself and challenge himself to expand personally just as Mr. Bolelli is challenging you to do here. If this book creates an emotional reaction in you (whether good or bad), then I believe it has done its job.

'You know, actually change something.'<br><br>'What, like "change the world", you mean?'<br><br>'Not the whole entire world. Just the little bit around you.'<br><br>They lay in silence for a moment, bodies curled around each other in the single bed, then both began to laugh in low, pre-dawn voices. 'Can't believe I just said that,' she groaned. 'Sounds a bit corny, doesn't it?'<br><br>'A bit corny.'<br><br>'I'm trying to be inspiring! I'm trying to lift your grubby soul for the great adventure that lies ahead of you.' She turned to face him. 'Not that you need it. I expect you've got your future nicely mapped out, ta very much. Probably got a little flow-chart somewhere or something.'<br><br>'Hardly.'<br><br>'So what're you going to do then? What's the great plan?'<br><br>'Well, my parents are going to pick up my stuff, dump it at theirs, then I'll spend a couple of days in their flat in London, see some friends. Then France-'<br><br>'Very nice-'<br><br>'Then China maybe, see what that's all about, then maybe onto India, travel around there for a bit-'<br><br>'<i>Traveling</i>,' she sighed. 'So predictable.'<br><br>'What's wrong with travelling?'<br><br>'Avoiding reality more like.'<br><br>'I think reality is over-rated,' he said in the hope that this might come across as dark and charismatic.<br><br>She sniffed. 'S'alright, I suppose, for those who can afford it. Why not just say "I'm going on holiday for two years"? It's the same thing.'<br><br>'Because travel broadens the mind,' he said, rising onto one elbow and kissing her.<br><br>'Oh I think you're probably a bit too broad-minded as it is,' she said, turning her face away, for the moment at least. They settled again on the pillow. 'Anyway, I didn't mean what are you doing next month, I meant the future-future, when you're, I don't know...' She paused, as if conjuring up some fantastical idea, like a fifth dimension. '...<i>Forty </i>or something. What do you want to be when you're forty?'<br><br>'Forty?' He too seemed to be struggling with the concept. 'Don't know. Am I allowed to say "rich"?'<br><br>'Just so, so shallow.'<br><br>'Alright then, "famous".' He began to nuzzle at her neck. 'Bit morbid, this, isn't it?'<br><br>'It's not morbid, it's...exciting.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>' 'Exciting!' ' He was imitating her voice now, her soft Yorkshire accent, trying to make her sound daft. She got this a lot, posh boys doing funny voices, as if there was something unusual and quaint about an accent, and not for the first time she felt a reassuring shiver of dislike for him. She shrugged herself away until her back was pressed against the cool of the wall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>'Yes, exciting. We're meant to be excited, aren't we? All those possibilities. It's like the Vice-Chancellor said, "the doors of opportunity flung wide..."'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>'"Yours are the names in tomorrow's newspapers..."'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>'<i>Not</i> very likely.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>'So, what, are you excited then?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>'Me? God no, I'm crapping myself.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>'Me too. Christ...' He turned suddenly and reached for the cigarettes on the floor by the side of the bed, as if to steady his nerves. 'Forty years old. Forty. Fucking hell.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Smiling at his anxiety, she decided to make it worse. 'So what'll you be doing when you're forty?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>He lit his cigarette thoughtfully. 'Well the thing is, Em-'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>'"Em"? Who's "Em"?'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>'People call you Em. I've heard them.'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>'Yeah, <i>friends</i> call me Em.'<br><br>'So can I call you Em?'<br><br>'Go on then, <i>Dex</i>.'<br><br>'So I've given this whole "growing old" thing some thought and I've come to the decision that I'd like to stay exactly as I am right now.'<br><br>Dexter Mayhew. She peered up at him through her fringe as he leant against the cheap buttoned vinyl headboard and even without her spectacles on it was clear why he might want to stay exactly this way. Eyes closed, the cigarette glued languidly to his lower lip, the dawn light warming the side of his face through the red filter of the curtains, he had the knack of looking perpetually posed for a photograph. Emma Morley thought 'handsome' a silly, nineteenth-century word, but there really was no other word for it, except perhaps 'beautiful'. He had one of those faces where you were aware of the bones beneath the skin, as if even his bare skull would be attractive. A fine nose, slightly shiny with grease, and dark skin beneath the eyes that looked almost bruised, a badge of honour from all the smoking and late nights spent deliberately losing at strip poker with girls from Bedales. There was something feline about him: eyebrows fine, mouth pouty in a self-conscious way, lips a shade too dark and full, but dry and chapped now, and rouged with Bulgarian red wine. Gratifyingly his hair was terrible, short at the back and sides, but with an awful little quiff at the front. Whatever gel he used had worn off, and now the quiff looked pert and fluffy, like a silly little hat.<br><br>Still with his eyes closed, he exhaled smoke through his nose. Clearly he knew he was being looked at because he tucked one hand beneath his armpit, bunching up his pectorals and biceps. Where did the muscles come from? Certainly not sporting activity, unless you counted skinny- dipping and playing pool. Probably it was just the kind of good health that was passed down in the family, along with the stocks and shares and the good furniture. Handsome then, or beautiful even, with his paisley boxer shorts pulled down to his hip bones and somehow here in her single bed in her tiny rented room at the end of four years of college. 'Handsome'! Who do you think you are, Jane Eyre? Grow up. Be sensible. Don't get carried away.<br><br>She plucked the cigarette from his mouth. 'I can imagine you at forty,' she said, a hint of malice in her voice. 'I can picture it right now.'<br><br>He smiled without opening his eyes. 'Go on then.'<br><br>'Alright-' She shuffled up the bed, the duvet tucked beneath her armpits. 'You're in this sports car with the roof down in Kensington or Chelsea or one of those places and the amazing thing about this car is it's silent, 'cause all the cars'll be silent in, I don't know, what - 2006?'<br><br>He scrunched his eyes to do the sum. '2004-'<br><br>'And this car is hovering six inches off the ground down the King's Road and you've got this little paunch tucked under the leather steering wheel like a little pillow and those backless gloves on, thinning hair and no chin. You're a big man in a small car with a tan like a basted turkey-'<br><br>'So shall we change the subject then?'<br><br>'And there's this woman next to you in sunglasses, your third, no, fourth wife, very beautiful, a model, no, an ex-model, twenty-three, you met her while she was draped on the bonnet of a car at a motor- show in Nice or something, and she's stunning and thick as shit-'<br><br>'Well that's nice. Any kids?'<br><br>'No kids, just three divorces, and it's a Friday in July and you're heading off to some house in the country and in the tiny boot of your hover car are tennis racquets and croquet mallets and a hamper full of fine wines and South African grapes and poor little quails and asparagus and the wind's in your widow's peak and you're feeling very, very pleased with yourself and wife number three, four, whatever, smiles at you with about two hundred shiny white teeth and you smile back and try not to think about the fact that you have nothing, absolutely nothing, to say to each other.'<br>&nbsp;<br>She came to an abrupt halt. You sound insane, she told herself. Do try not to sound insane. 'Course if it's any consolation we'll all be dead in a nuclear war long before then!' she said brightly, but still he was frowning at her.<br><br>'Maybe I should go then. If I'm so shallow and corrupt-'<br><br>'No, don't go,' she said, a little too quickly. 'It's four in the morning.'<br><br>He shuffled up the bed until his face was a few inches from hers. 'I don't know where you get this idea of me, you barely know me.'<br><br>'I know the type.'<br><br>'The type?'<br><br>'I've seen you, hanging round Modern Languages, braying at each other, throwing black-tie dinner parties-'<br><br>'I don't even own black-tie. And I certainly don't bray-'<br><br>'Yachting your way round the Med in the long hols, ra ra ra-'<br><br>'So if I'm so awful-' His hand was on her hip now.<br><br>'-which you are.'<br><br>'-then why are you sleeping with me?' His hand was on the warm soft flesh of her thigh.<br><br>'Actually I don't think I have slept with you, have I?'<br><br>'Well that depends.' He leant in and kissed her. 'Define your terms.' His hand was on the base of her spine, his leg slipping between hers.<br><br>'By the way,' she mumbled, her mouth pressed against his.<br><br>'What?' He felt her leg snake around his, pulling him closer.<br><br>'You need to brush your teeth.'<br><br>'I don't mind if you don't.'<br><br>'S'really horrible,' she laughed. 'You taste of wine and fags.'<br><br>'Well that's alright then. So do you.'<br><br>Her head snapped away, breaking off the kiss. 'Do I?'<br><br>'I don't mind. I like wine and fags.'<br><br>'Won't be a sec.' She flung the duvet back, clambering over him.<br><br>'Where are you going now?' He placed his hand on her bare back.<br><br>'Just the bog,' she said, retrieving her spectacles from the pile of books by the bed: large, black NHS frames, standard issue.<br><br>'The "bog", the "bog"...sorry I'm not familiar...'<br><br>She stood, one arm across her chest, careful to keep her back to him. 'Don't go away,' she said, padding out of the room, hooking two fingers into the elastic of her underpants to pull the material down at the top of her thighs. 'And no playing with yourself while I'm gone.'<br><br>He exhaled through his nose and shuffled up the bed, taking in the shabby rented room, knowing with absolute confidence that somewhere in amongst the art postcards and photocopied posters for angry plays there would be a photograph of Nelson Mandela, like some dreamy ideal boyfriend. In his last four years he had seen any number of bedrooms like this, dotted round the city like crime scenes, rooms where you were never more than six feet from a Nina Simone album, and though he'd rarely seen the same bedroom twice, it was all too familiar. The burnt out nightlights and desolate pot plants, the smell of washing powder on cheap, ill-fitting sheets. She had that arty girl's passion for photomontage too; flash-lit snaps of college friends and family jumbled in amongst the Chagalls and Vermeers and Kandinskys, the Che Guevaras and Woody Allens and Samuel Becketts. Nothing here was neutral, everything displayed an allegiance or a point of view. The room was a manifesto, and with a sigh Dexter recognised her as one of those girls who used 'bourgeois' as a term of abuse. He could understand why 'fascist' might have negative connotations, but he liked the word 'bourgeois' and all that it implied. Security, travel, nice food, good manners, ambition; what was he meant to be apologising for?<br><br>He watched the smoke curl from his mouth. Feeling for an ashtray, he found a book at the side of the bed. <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>, spine creased at the 'erotic' bits. The problem with these fiercely individualistic girls was that they were all exactly the same. Another book: <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i>. Silly bloody fool, he thought, confident that it was not a mistake he would ever make.<br><br>At twenty-three, Dexter Mayhew's vision of his future was no clearer than Emma Morley's. He hoped to be successful, to make his parents proud and to sleep with more than one woman at the same time, but how to make these all compatible? He wanted to feature in magazine articles, and hoped one day for a retrospective of his work, without having any clear notion of what that work might be. He wanted to live life to the extreme, but without any mess or complications. He wanted to live life in such a way that if a photograph were taken at random, it would be a cool photograph. Things should look right. Fun; there should be a lot of fun and no more sadness than absolutely necessary.<br><br>It wasn't much of a plan, and already there had been mistakes. Tonight, for instance, was bound to have repercussions: tears and awkward phone-calls and accusations. He should probably get out of here as soon as possible, and he glanced at his discarded clothes in preparation for his escape. From the bathroom came the warning rattle and bang of an ancient toilet cistern, and he hurriedly replaced the book, finding beneath the bed a small yellow Colman's mustard tin that he flipped open to confirm that, yes, it did contain condoms, along with the small grey remains of a joint, like a mouse dropping. With the possibility of sex <i>and</i> drugs in a small yellow tin he felt hopeful again, and decided that he might stay a little longer at least.<br>In the bathroom, Emma Morley wiped the crescents of toothpaste from the corner of her mouth and wondered if this was all a terrible mistake. Here she was, after four romantically barren years, finally, finally in bed with someone she really liked, had liked since she'd first seen him at a party in 1984, and in just a few hours he'd be gone. Forever probably. He was hardly likely to ask her to go to China with him, and besides she was boycotting China. And he was alright, wasn't he? Dexter Mayhew. In truth she suspected he wasn't all that bright, and a little too pleased with himself, but he was popular and funny and - no point fighting it - very handsome. So why was she being so stroppy and sarcastic? Why couldn't she just be self-confident and fun, like those scrubbed, bouncy girls he usually hung around with? She saw the dawn light at the tiny bathroom window. Sobriety. Scratching at her awful hair with her fingertips, she pulled a face, then yanked the chain of the ancient toilet cistern and headed back into the room.<br><br>From the bed, Dexter watched her appear in the doorway, wearing the gown and mortar board that they'd been obliged to hire for the graduation ceremony, her leg hooked mock-seductively around the doorframe, her rolled degree certificate in one hand. She peered over her spectacles and pulled the mortar board down low over one eye. 'What d'you think?'<br><br>'Suits you. I like the jaunty angle. Now take it off and come back to bed.'</p><h2>Antonio Stradivari: His Life and Work (Dover Books On Music: Violin)</h2><p><p>Leading appraisers of fine musical instruments agree that in the art of making violins, no one has ever gone beyond the achievement of Antonio Stradivari. The incomparable visual beauty of his instruments and the infinite variety and magnificence of tone of which they are capable have by this time passed into the realm of legend. Collectors have paid many thousands of dollars for one of Stradivari's violins. It is strange, but true, that only one book really delves into the life and art of this famous Italian craftsman. That is the book published in 1902 by the three Hill brothers of the London violin-making firm. Expert violin-makers and critics of superior violin craftsmanship, these men had unique opportunities to examine and compare almost all of the great examples of Italian violin-making.<br>The larger divisions of the book concern the ancestry of Stradivari; his violins, viols, and violoncellos; his aims in relation to tone; his materials; his varnish; his construction; his labels; the number of instruments he made; the growth of their reputation. Some of the topics discussed under these main headings are: Stradivari's apprenticeship to Amati; comparison of his work with that of Amati; the tone of the pre-1684 Stradivari violin; changes between 1684 and 1690; distinguishing characteristics of many existing violins, violas, and cellos, their specific location, etc.; erroneous views concerning Stradivari's material; his preference for the wood of certain trees in given years; the mystery of the ingredients of Stradivari's varnish; the effect of varnish on tone; the measurements of Stradivari's instruments; the time spent by Stradivari in making a violin; the years of greatest production; the largest number dating from one year; estimate of the total number made; an estimate of the actual sum he charged for an instrument; the introduction of Stradivari instruments into France and England; the first revelation of their supreme merit; and many other interesting topics.<br>Musicologists, violinists, makers of instruments, historians of culture, and those who count themselves simply as music lovers will find this to be an extremely interesting and informative account.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Mystery of the White Lions: Children of the Sun God</h2><p>This is Linda Tucker&#x2019;s firsthand account of her journey into the mysteries of the most sacred animal on the African continent: the legendary White Lion.

Marshall Grant, Cash&#39;s long-time bassist and one of the founding members of Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two, chronicles their rise to fame from humble beginnings to world renown.</p><p><b>Marshall Grant</b> played bass and served as road manager and stage manager for Johnny Cash. Following his career with the Man in Black, he managed the Statler Brothers until their retirement in 2004 and currently manages the solo career of Statler Brother Jimmy Fortune. He lives in Hernando, Mississippi, with his wife, Etta.When coworker Roy Cash introduced his fresh-out-of-the-air-force younger brother J. R. (<i>John,</i> then <i>Johnny,</i> came later) to him, Grant says, "a funny feeling--a kind of tingling--come [<i>sic</i>] over me." For the next 50 years, Roy's brother would loom over Grant's life, as he would over country music, like a colossus. Grant played bass in Cash's road bands until 1980. He was also Cash's road manager, making housing and travel arrangements and getting Cash to the gigs. That became a Herculean task as Cash's entourage, and his amphetamine and barbiturate addictions, begun as early as 1957, grew. Grant figures that Cash was entirely off pills for only the six years following his son John Carter Cash's birth in 1970. Cash finally fired Grant amid baseless allegations of embezzlement. A long lawsuit ensued, but the men reconciled shortly before Cash's death. Throughout this immaculately edited mounting of his oral testimony (kudos and then some to Zar), Grant maintains that, sober, Cash was utterly lovable. The man he primarily presents, in a voice that couldn't be more congenial and disingenuous, is, however, a monster of self-destruction. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But something&#x2014;or someone&#x2014;has begun picking off her sheep one by one. There are foxes in the woods, a strange man wandering the island, and rumors of a mysterious beast prowling at night. And there is Jake&#x2019;s relentless past&#x2014;one she tried to escape thousands of miles away and years ago, concealed in stubborn silence and isolation and the scars that stripe her back. With exceptional artistry, <i>All the Birds, Singing</i> plumbs a life of fierce struggle and survival, sounding depths of unexpected beauty and hard-won redemption.</p></p><p><p><b>EVIE WYLD</b>&nbsp;grew up in Australia and London, where she currently resides.

Crows, their beaks shining, strutting and rasping, and when I waved my stick they flew to the trees and watched, flaring out their wings, singing, if you could call it that. I shoved my boot in Dog&#x2019;s face to stop him from taking a string of her away with him as a souvenir, and he kept close by my side as I wheeled the carcass out of the field and down into the woolshed.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;d been up that morning, before the light came through, out there, talking to myself, telling the dog about the things that needed doing as the blackbirds in the hawthorn started up. Like a mad woman, listening to her own voice, the wind shoving it back down my throat and hooting over my open mouth like it had done every morning since I moved to the island. With the trees rattling in the copse and the sheep blaring out behind me, the same trees, the same wind and sheep.<br>&nbsp;<br>That made two deaths in a month. The rain started to come down, and a sudden gust of wind flung sheep shit at the back of my neck so it stung. I pulled up my collar and shielded my eyes with my hand.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Cree-cra, cold, cree-cra, cold.<br></i>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What are you laughing at?&#x201d; I shouted at the crows and lobbed a stone at them. I wiped my eyes with the back of my hand and breathed in and out heavily to get rid of the blood smell. The crows were silent. When I turned to look, five of them sat in a row on the same branch, eyeing me but not speaking. The wind blew my hair in my eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>#<br>&nbsp;<br>The farm shop at Marling had a warped and faded sign at the foot of its gate that read FREE BABY GUINEA PIGS. There was never any trace of the free guinea pigs and I had passed the point of being able to ask. The pale daughter of the owner was there, doing a crossword. She looked up at me, then looked back down like she was embarrassed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>She blushed but gave me the smallest of acknowledgements. She wore a thick green tracksuit and her hair was in a ponytail. Around her eyes was the faint redness that came after a night of crying or drinking.<br>&nbsp;<br>Normally the potatoes from that place were good, but they all gave a little bit when I picked them up. I put them back down and moved over to tomatoes, but they weren&#x2019;t any good either. I looked up out the window to where the farm&#x2019;s greenhouse stood and saw the glass was all broken.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said to the girl, who when I turned around was already looking at me, sucking the end of her pencil. &#x201c;What happened to your greenhouse?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The wind,&#x201d; she said, taking her pencil to the side of her mouth just for a moment. &#x201c;Dad said to say the wind blew it in.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I could see the glass scattered outside where normally they kept pots of ugly pink cyclamen with a sign that said THE JEWEL FOR YOUR WINTER GARDEN. Just black earth and glass now.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Things always get mad on New Year&#x2019;s Eve,&#x201d; said the girl in an older voice that surprised both of us. She blushed deeper and turned her eyes back to her crossword. In the greenhouse, the man who normally ran the shop sat with his head in his hands.<br>&nbsp;<br>I took some oranges and leeks and lemons to the counter. I didn&#x2019;t need anything, the trip was more about the drive than the supplies. The girl dropped her pencil out of her mouth and started to count oranges, but wasn&#x2019;t sure of herself and started again a few times over. There was a smell of alcohol about her, masked by too much perfume. A hangover then. I imagined an argument with her father. I looked up at the greenhouse again, the man in it still with his head in his hands, the wind blowing through.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Are there nine there?&#x201d; she asked, and even though I hadn&#x2019;t counted as I put them in the basket I said yes. She tapped things into the till.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Must be hard to lose the greenhouse,&#x201d; I said, noticing a small blue bruise at the girl&#x2019;s temple. She didn&#x2019;t look up.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not so bad. We should have had an order over from the mainland, but the ferry&#x2019;s not going today.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The ferry&#x2019;s not going?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Weather&#x2019;s too bad,&#x201d; she said, again in that old voice that embarrassed us both.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never known that to happen.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It happens,&#x201d; she said, putting my oranges in one bag and the rest in another. &#x201c;They built the new boats too big so they aren&#x2019;t safe in bad weather.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Do you know what the forecast is?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The girl glanced up at me quickly and lowered her eyes again.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No. Four pounds twenty please.&#x201d; She slowly counted out my money. It took two goes to get the change right. I wondered what new thing she&#x2019;d heard about me. It was time to leave, but I didn&#x2019;t move.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s with the free guinea pigs?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The flush came back to her face. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve gone. We gave them to my brother&#x2019;s snake. There were loads.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The girl smiled. &#x201c;It was years ago.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>The girl put the pencil back in her mouth and her eyes fluttered back down to her crossword. She was just colouring in the white squares, it turned out.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the truck, I found I had left the oranges in the shop. I looked out of my rear-view mirror at the smashed greenhouse and saw the man inside standing up with his hands on his hips looking at me. I locked the doors and drove away without the oranges.<br>&nbsp;<br>It started to rain heavily, and I turned up the heating and put the wipers on full speed. We drove past the spot I usually stopped to walk Dog and he sat in the passenger seat and stared at me hard, and every time I turned to look at him he put his ears up, like we were mid-conversation and I was avoiding his look. &#x201c;So what?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a dog.&#x201d; And then he turned around and looked out the window.<br>&nbsp;<br>#<br>&nbsp;<br>Midway home it caught up with me and I pulled over into the entrance to an empty field. Dog gazed stoically out the window, still and calm, and I pressed my thumb into the bridge of my nose to try and take away the prickling, clung on to the skin of my chest with the nails of my other hand to melt away that old -thudding ache that came with losing a sheep, a bead of blood landing in an open eye. I cried drily, honking and with my mouth open, rocking the truck and feeling something grappling around inside me getting no closer to coming out. <i>Have a good cry;</i> it was the kind of thing Mum&#x2019;d say to a triplet in the hope a visit to the hospital wasn&#x2019;t necessary. Like the time Cleve fell out of a tree and cried it out, and we found out later he had a broken arm. But there was nothing good in my crying&#x2014;it prevented me from breathing, it hurt. I stopped once my nose began to bleed, cleaned it up with the shammy I used on the days the windows were iced on the inside and drove home, calmly. On the Military Road near to the turning home, some teenagers fondled about at the bus stop. When they saw me coming one of the boys pretended to put something in his mouth, another mounted him from behind and humped him while he mimed throwing a lasso. The girls laughed and gave me the finger. As I rounded the corner the boy with the lasso dropped his trousers and showed his white arse.<br><br>#</p></p><h2>Growing Up Empty: How Federal Policies Are Starving America&#39;s Children</h2><p><p><i>Growing Up Empty</i> is a study of the hidden hunger epidemic that still remains largely unacknowledged at the highest political levels and "an unforgettable exploration of public policy, its failures and its victims" (William Raspberry, <i>Washington Post</i>).</p> <p>Twenty years after Ronald Reagan declared that hunger was no longer an American problem, Schwartz-Nobel shows that hunger has reached epic proportions, running rampant through urban, rural, and suburban communities, affecting blacks, whites, Asians, Christians and Jews, and nonbelievers alike.</p> <p>Among the people we come to know are the new homeless. Born of the "Welfare to Work" program, these working poor have jobs but do not make enough to support their families, such as the formerly middle-class housewife reduced to stealing in order to feed her children, or the soldier fighting on our front lines while his young wife stands in bread lines and is denied benefits and baby formula at a military health clinic.</p> With skillful investigative reporting and a novelist's humanitarian eye for detail, Schwartz-Nobel portrays a haunting reality of human suffering that need not exist.

In Ibsen's play, Nora Helmer has secretly (and deceptively) borrowed a large sum of money to pay for her husband, Torvald, to recover from illness on a sabbatical in Italy. Torvald's perception of Nora is of a silly, naive spendthrift, so it is only when the truth begins to emerge, and Torvald appreciates the initiative behind his wife, that unmendable cracks appear in their marriage.</p><p> This compelling new version of Ibsen's masterpiece by playwright Simon Stephens premiered at the Young Vic Theatre, London, on 29 June 2012.

In this book, Simona Ginsburg and Eva Jablonka propose a new theory about the origin of consciousness that finds learning to be the driving force in the transition to basic consciousness. Using a methodology similar to that used by scientists when they identified the transition from non-life to life, Ginsburg and Jablonka suggest a set of criteria, identify a marker for the transition to minimal consciousness, and explore the far-reaching biological, psychological, and philosophical implications.</p><p>After presenting the historical, neurobiological, and philosophical foundations of their analysis, Ginsburg and Jablonka propose that the evolutionary marker of basic or minimal consciousness is a complex form of associative learning, which they term unlimited associative learning (UAL). UAL enables an organism to ascribe motivational value to a novel, compound, non-reflex-inducing stimulus or action, and use it as the basis for future learning. Associative learning, Ginsburg and Jablonka argue, drove the Cambrian explosion and its massive diversification of organisms. Finally, Ginsburg and Jablonka propose symbolic language as a similar type of marker for the evolutionary transition to human rationality&#x2015;to Aristotle's &#x201c;rational soul.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Simona Ginsburg is Associate Professor in the Department of Natural Sciences, retired from the Open University of Israel.<br><br>Eva Jablonka is Professor at Tel-Aviv University.

It is the best synthesis I know about consciousness. It includes a fascinating history of the concepts and discoveries about consciousness together with an outstanding presentation of the most recent scientific data, theories and philosophical speculations. The evolution of consciousness from the 'Cambrian explosion' up to the Golem predicament is one among the many original aspects of the book.

Most impressive is the successful integration of philosophical, historical, neuroscientific, and biological considerations in addressing this most vexing question: How and why did consciousness emerge out of biological activity? By bringing together these different perspectives with impressive scholarship, the authors end up dissolving the hard problem to some extent &#x2015; which is exactly what we need to progress in our understanding of consciousness. The book itself is a long, involved read &#x2015; but a delightful and thrilling one. It feels like Dennett on steroids.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Axel Cleeremans</b>, Director, ULB Neuroscience Institute, Universit� libre de Bruxelles, Belgium<br><br><p>&#x201c;This book provides a thought-provoking perspective on one of the greatest questions in science today: what is consciousness, and how did it arise during evolution on planet Earth? Based on the view that consciousness subserves fulfillment of an animal's needs and goals, Ginsburg and Jablonka take us on an engaging journey from Aristotle to contemporary neuroscience, culminating in the daring but well-informed hypothesis that consciousness coheres with complex forms of learning. This book made me think differently of the Cambrian explosion of life, the roots of animal cognition, and the very origins of human thinking. This accessible and inspiring book offers a wealth of information and deep thought for everyone interested in the rich interface between biology, psychology, and philosophy.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Cyriel M. A. Pennartz</b>, Faculty of Science, Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands</p><h2>In the Wilderness: Coming of Age in Unknown Country</h2><p>Poet Kim Barnes grew up in northern Idaho, in the isolated camps where her father worked as a logger and her mother made a modest but comfortable home for her husband and two children. Their lives were short on material wealth, but long on the riches of family and friendship, and the great sheltering power of the wilderness. But in the mid-1960's, as automation and a declining economy drove more and more loggers out of the wilderness and into despair, Kim's father dug in and determined to stay. It was then the family turned fervently toward Pentecostalism. It was then things changed.<br><br><i>In the Wilderness</i> is the poet's own account of a journey toward adulthood against an interior landscape every bit as awesome, as beautiful, and as fraught with hidden peril as the great forest itself. It is a story of how both faith and geography can shape the heart and soul, and of the uncharted territory we all must enter to face our demons. Above all, it is the clear-eyed and moving account of a young woman's coming of terms with her family, her homeland, her spirituality, and herself.<br><br>In presenting Kim Barnes the 1995 PENJerard Fund Award for a work-in-progress by an emerging female writer, the panel of judges wrote that "<i>In the Wilderness</i> is far more than a personal memoir," adding that it stands "almost as a cautionary example of the power of good prose to distinguish whatever it touches." Indeed, <i>In the Wilderness</i> is an extraordinary work, courageous, candid, and exquisitely written.</p><p>In the mid-1960s, as mechanization and the forests&#39; depletion drove many loggers into the cities,Kim Barnes&#39;s parents turned to fundamentalism to sustain their increasingly difficult life. The author struggled to live by this religion&#39;s exacting tenets, but her chilling descriptions of the harsh punishments meted out for lapses make us understand why she ultimately had to leave it behind. Yet she conveys understanding and love for the rigid yet secure world of her youth in this haunting memoir of faith and loss in the Idaho woods.<b>Kim Barnes</b> is the author of the novel <i>Finding Caruso</i> and two memoirs, <i>In the Wilderness: Coming of Age in Unknown Country&#x2014;</i>a finalist for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize&#x2014;and <i>Hungry for the World</i>.

Preacher's onboard because the nation's fate depends on the passengers landing safe and sound. But it won't be easy. Two beautiful women make a play for Preacher. So does a killer. So does a band of river pirates. No sooner does Preacher beat back these threats than the riverboat lands in the middle of a blood-soaked Indian ambush--with a Prussian nobleman and his family taken hostage. Preacher has no choice but to go off in pursuit, even with a traitor trying to slaughter him. Someone wants to start a war and change the course of American history. Only a lone mountain man and the ambush of bullets he wields with deadly, unerring force stands in the way. . .</p><p><b>William W.

Austrian writer Ingeborg Bachmann (1926&#x2013;73) is recognized as one of post&#x2013;World War II German literature&#x2019;s most important novelists, poets, and playwrights. It seems only appropriate that these two contemporaries and masters of language were at one time lovers, and they shared a lengthy, artful, and passionate correspondence.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collected here for the first time in English are their letters written between 1948 and 1961. Their correspondence forms a moving testimony of the discourse of love in the age after Auschwitz, with all the symptomatic disturbances and crises caused by their&nbsp; conflicting backgrounds and their hard-to-reconcile designs for living&#x2014;as a woman, as a man, as writers. In addition to the almost 200 letters, the volume includes an important exchange between Bachmann and Gis�le Celan-Lestrange, who married Celan in 1951, as well as the letters between Paul Celan and Swiss writer Max Frisch.</p><p>&#x201c;Scarcely more breathlessly and desperately can two lovers ever have struggled for words.

In almost 200 letters, telegrams, postcards, unsent drafts, poems as love-letters, they tussle with the possibilities and limitations of communication through the written word. Silence and personal darkness have their place. The compromises exacted by life on art, the power and powerlessness of language, fear of the written word, and belief in dialogue through poetry are subjects broached. . . . Taken together, there seems no doubt that, in each other, Bachmann and Celan did have that precious, nigh-impossible fellow being: a companion &#x2018;you . . . for me . . . sensually and intellectually . . . the two cannot separate.'&#x201d;</p> (Rebecca K Morrison <i>(UK)</i>)<br><br>"Wieland Hoban has worked with accuracy and determination to capture the nuances of style and register, which include oblique awkwardness (Celan) and self-assuredness (Bachmann), alongside infinite courage and astounding strength (Celan-Lestrange).

The partisan ranks grew as did the training requirements for partisan commanders. The 1942 edition of <i>The Partisan's Companio</i>n helped quickly train new guerrillas to a common standard. Besides field craft, it covers partisan tactics, German counter-guerrilla tactics, demolitions, German and Soviet weapons, scouting, camouflage, ant-tank warfare and antiaircraft defense for squad and platoon-level instruction. It contains the Soviet lessons of two bitter years of war and provides a good look at the tactics and training of a mature partisan force. The partisans moved and lived clandestinely, harassed the enemy, and supported the Red Army through reconnaissance and attacks on German supply lines. They clearly frustrated German logistics and forced the Germans to periodically sideline divisions for rear-area security. The partisans and their handbook were clearly part of the eventual Soviet victory over Germany.

The year that he was away was simultaneously the longest and shortest year of my life. Every parent knows the joy and heartbreak of seeing a child grow: <br> the sleepy newborn phase gives way to giggles, and that first belly-inch forward becomes a full-on crawl. &#x201c;Enjoy it while it lasts,&#x201d; strangers would say with a smile, &#x201c;this time passes so quickly.&#x201d; It only made me more aware that my husband was missing everything. The milestones wouldn&#x2019;t wait. I ordered an entry-level DSLR and a kit lens, and I dove into shooting and learning. I took it upon myself to become a memory keeper. I sought out beauty in the details of daily life. I documented the nuances of emotion and expression that come and go in an instant. By the time my husband returned, photography had evolved from a way of capturing life to an integral part of my life altogether.<br><br> Everyone&#x2019;s story is a little bit different, but when I ask other women why they first picked up a camera, a common theme emerges. Many point to the birth of a child as commencing their journey. For others, loss, growth, or some other pivotal experience precipitated the desire to become a photographer. It&#x2019;s only natural that a heightened awareness of life&#x2019;s transience would lead to an overwhelming desire to begin capturing the moments that pass so quickly and the beauty often overlooked in our fast-paced world.<br><br> As the camera becomes an extension of ourselves, we realize the many ways that photography enhances our lives. Not only can we collect a visual representation of our memories for our future selves and others, but we can also use the camera as a vehicle for personal expression. We shoot what we love, letting our photographs represent our values by each subject that we choose to capture and the way we portray it. We become empowered to transform the elements in the frame to convey our moods and emotions. We may embrace the social aspects of the craft, sharing and learning with an ever-growing community of fellow photographers or connecting and engaging with our subjects while shooting. We may discover or develop a business opportunity, using a well-defined style and skill set to provide a professional service to clients. Or we may simply take an introspective moment for ourselves behind the lens, focusing on the way we want to capture our world and the truth, fiction, or poetry we quietly choose to create.<br> This book is at its heart a compendium of art and visual stories drawn from the portfolios of photographers across the globe, many of them working professionals, some independent artists, most of them mothers, all of them women. Each image wonderfully exemplifies the compositional principle, artistic technique, or educational tip that accompanies it. These images were originally created, however, not to demonstrate concepts but to let the ordinary emerge as extraordinary, share a message, or capture a moment in time. The result is a collection of photographs infused with artistry and creative perspectives on beauty that might otherwise go unnoticed.<br><br> The images are organized within instructional topic chapters, and the accompanying tips within each chapter progress from elementary to advanced. On each page, our contributing photographers have shared the camera, lens, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO applied in the creation of the image shown. Creativity exercises at the end of each chapter encourage you to explore the chapter principles and coax out further experimentation, imagination, and expression. And if you are new to photography, you may find it beneficial to the review the photographer&#x2019;s reference at the end of the book before you begin or when you come across a term with which you are unfamiliar as you progress.<br><br> It is said that photographers view life differently. Everything from the businessman striding down the sidewalk to succulent fruit at a farmer&#x2019;s market to scuffed shoes on the doormat becomes a potential subject in our minds. We can hardly contain ourselves when dusk sets a child&#x2019;s halo of curls aglow, and we love nothing more than an empty room filled with sunshine, the way shadows dance across our kitchen walls as daylight approaches, or the drama of tall trees enrobed in fog. We view rundown structures as feasts of textures and see evening&#x2019;s rush hour as an irresistible collection of lines, shapes, and colors. This book intends to help foster this way of seeing: to make knowledge and instruction accessible, to provide the motivation to advance, to help you illustrate your world powerfully, and&#x2014;above all&#x2014;to empower <br> you to embrace a passion as creator of beauty, keeper of memories, and teller <br> of stories.</p><h2>A Hunger for Healing Workbook</h2><p>A practical, exercise-filled companion to A Hunger for Healing that puts into practice the Christian principles of healing and growth<p></p><p>For many thousands of people, the Twelve Steps have become the spiritual discipline for a new decade, a way to turn to God and begin a pilgrimage toward wholeness as well as a journey out of addiction.

Yet even in a world defined entirely by men, a world where few thought it important to record a female's thoughts, women found ways to step forth. Elizabeth Ashbridge survived an abusive indenture to become a Quaker preacher. Anne Bradstreet penned her poems while raising eight children in the wilderness.

Although concealed from view, they are responsible for some powerful effects, particularly so when intensified by training. Exercises to achieve a well-conditioned pelvic floor, particularly when applied against the force of resistance, are capable of enhancing sexual function and ability as much as general fitness training can enhance athletic performance and endurance. A pelvic floor muscle-training regimen&#x2014;as with any good fitness program&#x2014;can impart better performance, increased strength (rigidity), improved endurance and stamina (ejaculatory control), and decreased recovery time (the amount of time it takes to achieve another erection).Conferring advantages that go way beyond the sexual domain, these often-neglected muscles are also vital to male genital-urinary health and serve an essential role in urinary function, bowel function and prostate health. A trained and fit pelvic floor will be helpful in improving as well as preventing the following problems: erectile dysfunction; orgasmic dysfunction; premature ejaculation; stress urinary incontinence that follows prostate surgery; overactive bladder; post-void dribbling; pelvic pain due to muscle spasm; bowel urgency and incontinence; and impairments resulting from saddle sports including bicycling, motorcycling and horseback riding. Virtually everybody is capable of achieving pelvic fitness through pelvicfloor muscle training and reaping the tangible rewards and &#x201c;member&#x201d; benefits that result.</p><p>Andrew L.

More than four million people in the United States alone are affected by peanut allergies, while there are few reported cases in India, a country where peanut is the primary ingredient in many baby food products. Where did this allergy come from, and does medicine play any kind of role in the phenomenon? After her own child had an anaphylactic reaction to peanut butter, historian Heather Fraser decided to discover the answers to these questions.<br><br>In <i>The Peanut Allergy Epidemic</i>, Fraser delves into the history of this allergy, trying to understand why it largely develops in children and studying its relationship with social, medical, political, and economic factors. In an international overview of the subject, she compares the epidemic in the United States to sixteen other geographical locations; she finds that in addition to the United States in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden, there is a one in fifty chance that a child, especially a male, will develop a peanut allergy. Fraser also highlights alternative medicines and explores issues of vaccine safety and other food allergies.<br><br>This third edition features a foreword from Robert F.

Bagge&#39;s riotous tales of the early 1990s subculture are more hilarious now than ever, find out why he has been praised by R. Crumb, Matt Groening, John Kricfalusi, Publishers Weekly, Entertainment Weekly and many more. Comedy genius.</p><p>Peter Bagge created&nbsp;Hate, one of the best-selling and most formative comic book series of the &#x2019;90s. Born in New York in 1957, after graduating from the School of Visual Arts, Bagge contributed to and, along with R. Crumb, edited the underground anthology Weirdo. Since then Bagge's numerous original graphic novels and collections of comics have won him two Harvey Awards (one for Best Cartoonist in 1991), an Inkpot Award, and garnered six Eisner Award nominations. His social commentary cartoons run in the magazine Reason, and his recent biography of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger is critically acclaimed. He lives in Seattle, Washington.Grade 10 Up&#x2013;Buddy, a 20-something Everyman for the Gen-X, slacker, whatever generation, moves from New Jersey to Seattle with his high-maintenance friend, Stinky. The fellow blunders through the typical challenges of early adulthood: finding a career, friends, sex, and love. To call him a loser does injustice to the term; although he is smart, his lack of ambition and pattern of bad choices manage to keep success just out of reach. All of the bad choices combine with constant whining, rationalizations, and philosophizing, making Buddy one of the best-wrought characters in independent comics. His life becomes an out-of-control train, and while it's obvious that every action will bring him nothing but more bad luck, readers can't help but go along for the ride, wincing and laughing all the way to the final crash. The supporting characters, including his bipolar girlfriend and his UFO-obsessed roommate, are equally well developed and serve to push Buddy's buttons throughout his episodic misadventures. Set against the backdrop of Seattle in the 1990s, the story pokes a little fun at all the Internet start-up companies, flannel-wearing grunge rockers, and overpriced coffee bars that made up much of the city. Although influenced by talents like R. Crumb, Bagge's artwork feels unique. The cityscapes of Seattle are realistically rendered, while the characters are done in a looser, cartoon style that gets really wild whenever a character undergoes stress. Newcomers and old fans alike shouldn't miss this collection.<i>&#x2013;Matthew L.

"Shake it, baby, shake it!" "Go, cat, go!" "We're gonna rock..."</p><p>This is where rock 'n' roll was born-the record company that launched Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, and Carl Perkins.

Escott lives in Toronto, Hawkins in London.</p>This culmination of a work in progress since 1971 follows the authors' earlier Catalyst: The Sun Records Story ( 1975) and Sun Records: The Brief History of the Legendary Record Label ( LJ 2/15/81) as their most detailed and critically astute evaluation of the seminal Sun Records and its founder and creative genius Sam Phillips. The developments of Sun and the nascent rock 'n' roll phenomenon in the early 1950s are inextricably entwined through Phillips's recordings of Howlin' Wolf, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis, all of whom began their careers at Sun. In explicating the "Sun sound," Escott and Hawkins also document Phillips's mistakes, flaws, and failures. The stories individually are wonderful, and collectively they form a lush composition of a significant slice of rock 'n' roll history. Numerous pictures, newspaper clippings, and other scrapbook paraphernalia complement the text, along with a Sun Records discography.

In<i> Mystagogy of the Eucharist</i> Gilbert Ostdiek, OFM, draws on ritual actions, liturgical symbols, prayer texts, and reflective commentary to help participants in the liturgy name and reflect on the meaning that Eucharist has for daily life. This book is offered as a practical, pastoral resource for those engaged in the ongoing formation of worshipers and their liturgical ministers.<br></p><p>Gilbert Osdiek, OFM, is professor of liturgy at Catholic Theological Union, an ordained presbyter, and a member of the Franciscan Province of the Sacred Heart. He has received a Festschrift, <i>Finding Voice to Give God Praise: Essays in the Many Languages of the Liturgy</i>, edited by Kathleen Hughes (Liturgical Press). He is the author of numerous publications and the winner in 2014 of the prestigious Berakah Award of the North American Academy of Liturgy.<br><i>Mystagogy of the Eucharist </i>is an excellent resource that weaves together practice and theory. The reflective process which is offered to parish ministers and teachers enables both the catechist and the community to more fully understand the biblical process of mystagogy and its meaning for one's life.<br> Catherine Dooley, OP, emerita, Catholic University of America, Washington, DC<br><br>Anyone who has been involved in the study and practice of liturgical catechesis over the past twenty five years has benefitted from the work of Gilbert Ostdiek.<i> Mystagogy of the Eucharist </i>offers a brilliant synthesis: an engaging framework for mystagogical reflection and its flexible application to each segment of the Eucharistic liturgy. What do we do? What does it mean? Whether you are reading this as a liturgist, catechist or first time participant in mystagogical reflection upon the experience of Eucharist, you cannot help but be drawn into Mystery. In responding to the Church's call for new evangelization, I highly recommend this text for anyone facilitating parish faith development or religious formation.<br> Mary Ann Clarahan, RSM, Professor of Liturgy and Sacraments, Pontificio Collegio Beda, Rome<br><br>Many people have come to associate mystagogy with the rites of Initiation, it being in the narrow sense the period between Easter and Pentecost. But mystagogy is more than a period of time; it is a way of knowing from ritual experience. Gil Ostdiek applies this principle as he reflects upon the Eucharist drawing upon the liturgical symbols, prayer texts and ritual actions of the Mass. He provides a wonderful pastoral resource for liturgical ministers and those responsible for liturgical formation. Anyone reading this book will come to savor the liturgy to a greater extent knowing the Eucharist from within.<br> Michael S. Driscoll, Professor of Liturgical Studies and Sacred Music at the University of Notre Dame<br><br>The paschal mystery is the key to understanding our lives as Christians. In Fr. Gilbert Ostdiek's <i>Mystagogy of the Eucharist,</i> pastors and catechists have an invaluable resource to deepen their community's celebration, understanding, and participation in the Eucharist, which is our communal and individual entry into the paschal mystery.<br> Rev. Joseph E. Weiss, SJ, Pastor, Saint Thomas More Catholic Community, Saint Paul, Minnesota<br><br>Like liturgy and catechesis, to do mystagogy well is an art. Yet as with any art, the basic, foundational techniques can be broken down and learned. In this book, Fr. Ostdiek teaches you those basic skills and walks with you step by step on your way to mastering the art of mystagogy. Fr. Ostdiek leads you with passion and poetry to an ever deeper understanding of the mysteries we celebrate, and with substantial catechetical material and practical examples, he shows you how to do the same for others. He invites you to make new connections to your own experience. Preachers, priests, liturgists, all catechists-anyone who wants to help people connect more deeply to the Sunday liturgy-will find the inspiration and confidence they need to be artful guides through whom Christ can open eyes and ignite hearts.<br> Diana Macalintal, Director of Worship, Diocese of San Jose, and co-founder of TeamRCIA.com<br><br>There are manifold riches here for the mystagogical reflection of God&#x2019;s people. I would absolutely use this book with any group of disciples who want to dig more deeply into &#x2018;why&#x2019; we do &#x2018;what&#x2019; we do. While sound scholarship abounds and sources are well-cited, the text itself is very accessible, practical, and pastoral. It is a fine resource for all engaged in this new renaissance of mystagogical reflection in the life of the church.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeremy Helmes<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pastoral Music<br><br>This resource will assist parish leaders in creatively forming and immersing parishioners in the symbols of the faith.<i>Pastoral Liturgy</i></p><h2>Home on Huckleberry Hill (The Matchmakers of Huckleberry Hill)</h2><p><i>Huckleberry Hill, Wisconsin&#x2019;s irrepressible eighty-something matchmakers Anna and Felty Helmuth are at it again.

Formerly a professor of history at the University of Hawaii, Dr. Kuzminski has been Resident Scholar in Philosophy at Hartwick College since 1997. Dr. Kuzminski has also been a public official and candidate for office who has worked for political change through both the Green and Democratic parties, as well as through various environmental groups. <em>Fixing the System </em>was born out of the fusion of his political experience with his scholarly passions. He is also author of <em>The Soul</em>, published in 1994, and of the forthcoming <em>Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism. </em><em>"Fixing the System</em> is, as it were, a rare new book, one in which a serious political theorist does startlingly original and important thinking about populism, democracy, and our present American society. Tracing the history of populism through two and a half centuries, Kuzminski eviscerates the allegedly democratic American system as collective authoritarianism and presents populism rooted in decentralized economic justice as an approximately egalitarian democratic alternative. Expect, if you read Kuzminski, to be shaken up where it most matters: in your mind."- Ronnie Dugger, founding editor of <em>The Texas Observer</em> and co-founder of the Alliance for Democracy.<br><br>"Kuzminski (philosophy, Hartwick College) laments the substitution of representative democracy and capitalist economics, amounting to plutocracy, for a genuinely democratic system of direct popular rule by citizens who "do not differ significantly in wealth and power."...Kuzminski's rhetoric is shrill, his political and economic judgments unsupported by factual evidence, and his prose repetitive and filled with typos. Summing Up: Not recommended." - D. Schaefer, <em>CHOICE</em>, January 2009 (Negative)<br><br>"This gracefully written, broadly researched study is a work of many aspects. It is part history and part philosophy and also has a psychological dimension....More important: Fixing the System is sound intellectual history, a serious contribution to the study of American economic and political thought. Kuzminski is an intellectual, a thinker, and all the populist writers, from Phaleas via Aristotle through Harrington, Jefferson, Kellogg et al., have been intellectuals, thinkers. They presented their ideas in books and essays and in letters. They did not institute their ideas or make notable efforts to institute them. Kuzminski's notable contribution is not in the presentation of practical measure to achieve political and economic equality but to present an ideal system for that achievement...This is a serious study by a deeply thoughtful observer of present-day politics and economics and a student of the complexities of these activities through the centuries...It should be read by anyone interested in the human past and the human present." &#x2014;<em>New York History</em>, Spring 2008<br><br>"Focusing primarily on populism in the West, Kuzminski traces populism's origins back to the days of Greek city states such as Athens. He also offers a withering critique of the state of most Western democracies, which he views as corporate oligarchies that perpetuate themselves by means of plebiscites that only provide passive popular acquiescence to the chosen policies of an elite. And he writes that no system can be called democratic unless citizens are owners of property and have a direct, active involvement in the formation of the policies of their government. Populists claim that 'property for all' means the widespread personal ownership of private capital sufficient to establish the relative economic independence of citizens. When none are rich enough to dominate others, and none are poor enough to be dominated, the public rather than the private interest is likely to be served."<br>David Isenberg, The Journal of Peace Research<br><br>"Kuzminski (philosophy, Hartwick College) laments the substitution of representative democracy and capitalist economics, amounting to plutocracy, for a genuinely democratic system of direct popular rule by citizens who "do not differ significantly in wealth and power."...Kuzminski's rhetoric is shrill, his political and economic judgments unsupported by factual evidence, and his prose repetitive and filled with typos.

Kuzminski is an intellectual, a thinker, and all the populist writers, from Phaleas via Aristotle through Harrington, Jefferson, Kellogg et al., have been intellectuals, thinkers. They presented their ideas in books and essays and in letters. They did not institute their ideas or make notable efforts to institute them. Kuzminski&#x2019;s notable contribution is not in the presentation of practical measure to achieve political and economic equality but to present an ideal system for that achievement...This is a serious study by a deeply thoughtful observer of present-day politics and economics and a student of the complexities of these activities through the centuries...It should be read by anyone interested in the human past and the human present.&#x201d; &#x2013;<em>New York History</em>, Spring 2008<br><br>"Focusing primarily on populism in the West, Kuzminski traces populism&#x2019;s origins back to the days of Greek city states such as Athens. He also offers a withering critique of the state of most Western democracies, which he views as corporate oligarchies that perpetuate themselves by means of plebiscites that only provide passive popular acquiescence to the chosen policies of an elite. And he writes that no system can be called democratic unless citizens are owners of property and have a direct, active involvement in the formation of the policies of their government. Populists claim that 'property for all&#x2019; means the widespread personal ownership of private capital sufficient to establish the relative economic independence of citizens. When none are rich enough to dominate others, and none are poor enough to be dominated, the public rather than the private interest is likely to be served."<br>David Isenberg, The Journal of Peace Research</p><h2>Stardust of Yesterday (de Piaget Family)</h2><p>A young woman inherits a castle&#x2014;along with a ghost who tries to scare her away. Her biggest fear, however, is falling in love with him.</p><p>I hope you haven't missed this classic debut novel from 1996. Lynn Kurland writes with the same charm and flair as Jude Deveraux, and this clever and original ghost story is akin to the fabulous, <i>Knight in Shining Armor</i>. The book has garnered award nominations from <i>Romantic Times</i> and <i>Romance Writers of America</i>, and will definitely be a fixture on my "keeper" shelf. When Genevieve inherits a castle, she isn't expecting the incredibly sexy 13th century knight that accompanies it. Unfortunately, he's a ghost, so fantasy is all Genevieve and Kendrick de Paiget are able to share until Kendrick actually becomes corporeal, and Genevieve has to overcome her fear of the flesh. Hardly your normal problem with a ghost!Lynn Kurland is the <b>USA Today</b> bestselling author of <b>Stardust of Yesterday, A Dance Through Time, This Is All I Ask, The Very Thought of You, Another Chance to Dream, The More I See You</b>, and <b>If I Had You</b>.

This is due to a number of influencing cultural, social, and political factors that disable our food production systems and limit our base of knowledge--falsely guiding us on a path of pseudo sustainability, while we devastate the ecosystems that support us, cause mass extinctions, and generate narrowing time lines that will ultimately jeopardize our very survival as a civilization. </p><p><i>Food Choice and Sustainability</i> is a groundbreaking new book that anyone who cares about our future and that of other species should read--individuals, academic institutions, businesses, organizations, and policy makers. Categories of global depletion are detailed, widely held myths are debunked, critical disconnects are exposed, and profound solutions are offered.</p></p><p>&#x201c;The importance of Dr. Richard Oppenlander's work to save planet Earth and its animal inhabitants exceeds the importance of reversing epidemic diseases of gluttony, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Both goals, by no coincidence, require an immediate worldwide substitution of meat and dairy for common starches (rice, corn, potatoes) in the human diet.&#x201d; &#x2014;John McDougall, MD, Internist, Author, and Researcher "Dr. Oppenlander's important work shows how the long-term health of our planet and its inhabitants will be determined, in large part, by our willingness to adopt a plant-based diet en masse. In reading Food Choice and Sustainability, one may find empowerment that such a simple and effective remedy can begin at our next meal." &#x2014;Brian Wendel, Creator and Executive Producer of Forks Over Knives &#x201c;Food Choice and Sustainability makes a powerful case for how we can protect our environment.

Food Choice and Sustainability is an impeccably documented, shocking, but vital wake-up call that intricately weaves food choice to the destruction of the planet, offering the one and only solution: the evolution to a plant-based diet. Dr. Oppenlander's brilliant tome is a frightening, yet inspiring call to arms that needs to be considered by all inhabitants of Earth.&#x201d; &#x2014;Julieanna Hever, MS, RD, CPT, author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Plant-Based Nutrition and host of Veria's wellness talk show, What Would Julieanna Do? "Dr. Oppenlander's remarkable book clearly makes the case imperative: our food choices are degrading our climate, exhausting our natural resources and creating monumental struggles for people in developing world nations. We must raise our awareness and make ethical and moral food choices." &#x2014;Jon Stryker, President and Founder, Arcus Foundation<p>Dr. Oppenlander is a consultant, researcher, and author whose award-winning book <i>Comfortably Unaware</i> has been endorsed as a must-read by Ellen DeGeneres, Dr. Jane Goodall and Neal Barnard, among many others.

Iacocca believed that leaders are made in times of crisis&#x2014;such as today. He knew more leaders than almost anyone else&#x2014;among them nine U.S. presidents, many heads of state, and the CEOs of the nation's top corporations&#x2014;and is uniquely suited to share his wisdom, knowledge, and wit about the leadership of America.<br> <br> Author of the gigantic number one bestsellers <i>Iacocca: An Autobiography</i> and <i>Talking Straight</i>, Lee Iacocca famously didn't mince words and in this, his last book, offers his no-nonsense, straight-up assessments of many of the most well-known American politicians of the era.<br> <br>Confessing that he has "flunked retirement," Iacocca calls on citizens of all ages to vote, get involved, and choose our leaders carefully. Along the way, he shares stories about the prominent people he's met and known, including the time he smoked cigars with Fidel Castro, what Bob Hope told him about how to live a long life, what Lady Sarah Ferguson said to him as they danced, why Bill Clinton woke him up in Italy, what Robert McNamara taught him about success, how Frank Sinatra sang for him personally, and whom Pope John Paul II asked him to pray for.

Where the hell is our outrage? We should be screaming bloody murder. We've got a gang of clueless bozos steering our ship of state right over a cliff, we've got corporate gangsters stealing us blind, and we can't even clean up after a hurricane much less build a hybrid car. But instead of getting mad, everyone sits around and nods their heads when the politicians say, "Stay the course."</p><p><i>Stay the course?</i> You've got to be kidding. This is <i>America</i>, not the damned <i>Titanic</i>. I'll give you a sound bite: <i>Throw the bums out!</i></p><p>You might think I'm getting senile, that I've gone off my rocker, and maybe I have. But someone has to speak up. I hardly recognize this country anymore. The President of the United States is given a free pass to ignore the Constitution, tap our phones, and lead us to war on a pack of lies. Congress responds to record deficits by passing a huge tax cut for the wealthy (thanks, but I don't need it). The most famous business leaders are not the innovators but the guys in handcuffs. While we're fiddling in Iraq, the Middle East is burning and nobody seems to know what to do. And the press is waving pom-poms instead of asking hard questions. That's not the promise of America my parents and yours traveled across the ocean for. I've had enough. How about you?</p><p>I'll go a step further. You can't call yourself a patriot if you're <i>not</i> outraged. This is a fight I'm ready and willing to have.</p><p>My friends tell me to calm down. They say, "Lee, you're eighty-two years old. Leave the rage to the young people." I'd love to -- as soon as I can pry them away from their iPods for five seconds and get them to pay attention. I'm going to speak up because it's my patriotic duty. I think people will listen to me. They say I have a reputation as a straight shooter. So I'll tell you how I see it, and it's not pretty, but at least it's real. I'm hoping to strike a nerve in those young folks who say they don't vote because they don't trust politicians to represent their interests. Hey, America, wake up. These guys work for <i>us</i>.</p><p>WHO ARE THESE GUYS, ANYWAY?</p><p>Why are we in this mess? How did we end up with this crowd in Washington? Well, we voted for them -- or at least some of us did. But I'll tell you what we <i>didn't</i> do. We didn't agree to suspend the Constitution. We didn't agree to stop asking questions or demanding answers. Some of us are sick and tired of people who call free speech treason. Where I come from that's a dictatorship, not a democracy.</p><p>And don't tell me it's all the fault of right-wing Republicans or liberal Democrats. That's an intellectually lazy argument, and it's part of the reason we're in this stew. We're not just a nation of <i>factions</i>. We're a <i>people</i>. We share common principles and ideals. And we rise and fall together.</p><p>Where are the voices of leaders who can inspire us to action and make us stand taller? What happened to the strong and resolute party of Lincoln? What happened to the courageous, populist party of FDR and Truman? There was a time in this country when the voices of great leaders lifted us up and made us want to do better. Where have all the leaders gone?</p><p>THE TEST OF A LEADER</p><p>I've never been Commander in Chief, but I've been a CEO. I understand a few things about leadership at the top. I've figured out nine points -- not ten (I don't want people accusing me of thinking I'm Moses). I call them the "Nine Cs of Leadership." They're not fancy or complicated. Just clear, obvious qualities that every true leader should have. We should look at how the current administration stacks up. Like it or not, this crew is going to be around until January 2009. Maybe we can learn something before we go to the polls in 2008. Then let's be sure we use the leadership test to screen the candidates who say they want to run the country. It's up to us to choose wisely.</p><p>So, here's my C list:</p><p>A leader has to show <b>CURIOSITY</b>. He has to listen to people outside of the "Yes, sir" crowd in his inner circle. He has to read voraciously, because the world is a big, complicated place. George W. Bush brags about never reading a newspaper. "I just scan the headlines," he says. Am I hearing this right? He's the President of the United States and he never reads a newspaper? Thomas Jefferson once said, "Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter." Bush disagrees. As long as he gets his daily hour in the gym, with Fox News piped through the sound system, he's ready to go.</p><p>If a leader never steps outside his comfort zone to hear different ideas, he grows stale. If he doesn't put his beliefs to the test, how does he know he's right? The inability to listen is a form of arrogance. It means either you think you already know it all, or you just don't care. Before the 2006 election, George Bush made a big point of saying he didn't listen to the polls. Yeah, that's what they all say when the polls stink. But maybe he <i>should</i> have listened, because 70 percent of the people were saying he was on the wrong track. It took a "thumping" on election day to wake him up, but even then you got the feeling he </p><p>wasn't listening so much as he was calculating how to do a better job of convincing everyone he was right.</p><p>A leader has to be <b>CREATIVE</b>, go out on a limb, be willing to try something different. You know, <i>think outside the box</i>. George Bush prides himself on never changing, even as the world around him is spinning out of control. God forbid someone should accuse him of flip-flopping. There's a disturbingly messianic fervor to his certainty. Senator Joe Biden recalled a conversation he had with Bush a few months after our troops marched into Baghdad. Joe was in the Oval Office outlining his concerns to the President -- the explosive mix of Shiite and Sunni, the disbanded Iraqi army, the problems securing the oil fields. "The President was <i>serene</i>," Joe recalled. "He told me he was sure that we were on the right course and that all would be well. 'Mr. President,' I finally said, 'how can you be so sure when you don't yet know all the facts?'" Bush then reached over and put a steadying hand on Joe's shoulder. "My instincts," he said. "My instincts." Joe was flabbergasted. He told Bush, "Mr. President, your instincts aren't good enough." Joe Biden sure didn't think the matter was settled. And, as we all know now, it <i>wasn't</i>.</p><p>Leadership is all about managing change -- whether you're leading a company or leading a country. Things change, and you get creative. You adapt. Maybe Bush was absent the day they covered that at Harvard Business School.</p><p>A leader has to <b>COMMUNICATE</b>. I'm not talking about running off at the mouth or spouting sound bites. I'm talking about facing reality and telling the truth. Nobody in the current administration seems to know how to talk straight anymore. Instead, they spend most of their time trying to convince us that things are not really as bad as they seem. I don't know if it's denial or dishonesty, but it can start to drive you crazy after a while. Communication has to start with telling the truth, even when it's painful. The war in Iraq has been, among other things, a grand failure of communication. Bush is like the boy who <i>didn't</i> cry wolf when the wolf was at the door. After years of being told that all is well, even as the casualties and chaos mount, we've stopped listening to him.</p><p>A leader has to be a person of <b>CHARACTER</b>. That means knowing the difference between right and wrong and having the guts to do the right thing. Abraham Lincoln once said, "If you want to test a man's character, give him power." George Bush has a lot of power. What does it say about his character? Bush has shown a willingness to take bold action on the world stage because he has the <i>power</i>, but he shows little regard for the grievous consequences. He has sent our troops (not to mention hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi citizens) to their deaths -- for what? To build our oil reserves? To avenge his daddy because Saddam Hussein once tried to have him killed? To show his daddy he's tougher? The motivations behind the war in Iraq are questionable, and the execution of the war has been a disaster. A man of character does not ask a single soldier to die for a failed policy.</p><p>A leader must have <b>COURAGE</b>. I'm talking about <i>balls.</i> (That even goes for female leaders.) Swagger isn't courage. Tough talk isn't courage. George Bush comes from a blue-blooded Connecticut family, but he likes to talk like a cowboy. You know, <i>My gun is bigger than your gun</i>. Courage in the twenty-first century doesn't mean posturing and bravado. Courage is a commitment to sit down at the negotiating table and <i>talk</i>.</p><p>If you're a politician, courage means taking a position even when you know it will cost you votes. Bush can't even make a public appearance unless the audience has been handpicked and sanitized. He did a series of so-called town hall meetings last year, in auditoriums packed with his most devoted fans. The questions were all softballs.</p><p>To be a leader you've got to have <b>CONVICTION</b> -- a fire in your belly. You've got to have passion. You've got to really want to get something done. How do you measure fire in the belly? Bush has set the all-time record for number of vacation days taken by a U.S. President -- four hundred and counting. He'd rather clear brush on his ranch than immerse himself in the business of governing. He even told an interviewer that the high point of his presidency so far was catching a seven-and-a-half-pound perch in his hand-stocked lake.</p><p>It's no better on Capitol Hill. Congress was in session only ninety-seven days in 2006. That's eleven days less than the record set in 1948, when President Harry Truman coined the term <i>do-nothing Congress</i>. Most people would expect to be fired if ...</p></p><h2>By One Vote: The Disputed Presidential Election of 1876 (American Presidential Elections)</h2><p>With electoral votes disputed in three states a Democrat winning the popular vote and the Supreme Court stepping in to overrule Florida court decisions the presidential election of 1876 was an eerie precursor to that of 2000 Rutherford Hayess defeat of Samuel Tilden has been dubbed the fraud of the century now one of Americas preeminent political historians digs deeper to unravel its real significance This election saw the highest voter turnout of any in U S historya whopping 82 percentand also the narrowest margin of victory as a single electoral vote decided the outcome Michael Holt offers a fresh interpretation of this disputed election not merely to rehash claims of fraud but to explain why it was so close Examining the post-Civil War political environment he particularly focuses on its most curious feature that Republicans were the only party in history to retain the presidency in the middle of a severe depression after decisively losing the preceding off-year congressional elections Holt begins with the election of 1872 to demonstrate how competition for Liberal Republicans shaped the campaign strategies of both parties He stresses the critical but little-noted importance of Colorado statehood in Augustwhich changed the size of the electoral-vote majority needed to winand provides a new answer to the vexing question of why a Democratic-controlled Congress had admitted Colorado in time to participate in the presidential election when without its votes Tilden would have won And he argues that the high voter turnout was attributable both to Republicans exploiting fears of ex-Confederates recapturing control of the government and to long-apathetic southern Democrats reacting to war memories and Reconstruction realities By One Vote shows how this election triggered a Republican revival and established the GOP as the Democrats major competitor Holts compelling analysis of the dispute over electoral votes also explains why charges of Republican frau</p><p>"A marvelous example of Michael Holt's brand of political history, <i>By One Vote</i> is rich in the details of political maneuver, but also full of fresh and provocative insights."--Michael Perman, author of <i>The Road to Redemption: Southern Politics, 1869-1879</i><p> "Holt uncovers what really happened in the 1876 election and provides a clear window on the ambiguity of America's political process, an ambiguity still unresolved in today's America."--Heather Cox Richardson, author of <i>The Death of Reconstruction: Race, Labor, and Politics in the Post-Civil War North, 1865-1901</i></p><p> "A first rate accomplishment by a superb scholar."--Joel H.

This globetrotting adventure is fueled by Valiant's obsessive search for his bride-to-be Aleta throughout Northern Africa, with stops in Jerusalem, the Arabic deserts, and, inevitably, a harem which Val must infiltrate. Then finally, in "The Misty Isles" Valiant meets Aleta face-to-face, but upon learning that she has had his crew killed (deservedly so, actually, but still), he flees in anger, vowing never to see her again. "Homeward Bound," Valiant continues his travels, with stops in Athens (where he meets the boisterous Viking Boltar, who will become his friend for life), North Africa, and Gaul (where Valiant liberates Gawain), before finally returning to Camelot. But his joyous return is short-lived as an alliance of Picts and Vikings threatens Britain's security, and thus Valiant must journey forth with, as his ultimate destination, "The Roman Wall." </li></ul></p><p><strong>Hal Foster</strong> (1892-1982) created <em>Prince Valiant</em> in 1937.

It brings to life the day-to-day existence of people facing the obstacles of working in the fields and raising a family in an environment that is frequently hostile to those who have little education and speak another language. Assimilation brings its own problems, as the original culture is attenuated and the quality of family relationships is comprimised, consequences that are not inevitable but are instead a series of choices made along the way. It is also the story of how the author overcame the disadvantages of this background and found herself.</p><p>Hart's expressive and remarkably affecting memoir concerns her childhood as the daughter of Mexican immigrants who worked as migrant workers to feed their six children. In 1953, when she was only three, her parents took the family from Texas to work in the fields of Minnesota and Wisconsin for the first time, only to find that in order to comply with the child labor law they had to leave the author and her 11-year-old sister to board in a local Catholic school, where they pined for the rest of the family. Hart remembers other years when the entire family participated in the backbreaking field labor, driven mercilessly by Apa (her father), who was determined to earn enough money to allow all his children to graduate from high school. Apa not only achieved his goal but was able to save $2000 so that Hart could enter college, a step that led to her earning a master's degree in computer science. This account is not, however, an ordinary memoir of triumph over adversity. Instead, Hart eloquently reveals the harsh toll that poverty and discrimination took on her familyAin sharply etched portraits of Ama, Hart's worn-out mother who clearly loved her daughter but was too exhausted to show it; of her brother Rudy, who refused to sit at the back of the bus because he was a Mexican; and of her teenage sisters, who struggled to keep their dignity in the muddy fields. She recalls many painful incidents in school and with childhood friends that stemmed from being Mexican in a small white Texas town. At 17, she drove her father back to Mexico to visit his family; she recalls how he suddenly changed into a happy man who felt at home with his land, his language and his people. This is a beautifully written debut from a writer to watch.

These practical, ghostly, and often very funny tales come from a variety of Sufi works, including those by saints like Rumi as well as lay storytellers from Turkey and Persia. Some stories are religious allegories, such as those from the life of Jesus or Jonah as told by Muslim storytellers, and will be of interest to comparative religion aficionados. Other stories are twisted fairy tales such as "The Lady and the Golden Lampstand," in which the prince is unable to save anyone and the Cinderella-like heroine must be her own fairy godmother. In addition to sharing serious lessons, Douglas-Klotz includes a host of popular, humorous characters that many readers will recognize--particularly Mullah Nasruddin, whose capers are well-known throughout the Muslim world.

From the 1870s to the present day, Ojibwe bead artists of Minnesota have been especially well known for their lively, creative designs. Neighboring Dakota people would trade a pony for a beautiful beaded bag.<br>Over the years, non-Indian collectors and ethnographers, struck by the bags' cultural significance and visual appeal, bought them up. Today, there are hundreds of bags in museums around the world, but not so many in the hands of community members. In <em>A Bag Worth a Pony</em>, Marcia G.

The boy introduces St George to the dragon, and the two decide that it would be better for them not to fight. Eventually, they decide to stage a fake joust between the two combatants. As the two have planned, St George harmlessly spears the dragon through a shallow fold of skin suggested by the dragon, and the townsfolk rejoice (though not all of them, as some had placed bets on the dragon winning). St George then proclaims that the dragon is reformed in character, and he assures the townsfolk that the dragon is not dangerous. So the dragon is then accepted by the people.</p><p></p><h2>Culturally Alert Counseling: A Comprehensive Introduction</h2><p><strong>Culturally Alert Counseling: A Comprehensive Introduction</strong> is a reader-friendly introduction to the cultural dimensions of counseling and psychotherapy. Editor Garrett McAuliffe, along with international experts in their fields, provides an accessible presentation of culturally alert counseling techniques that broadens the discussion of culture from ethnicity and race to include social class, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. Culture is defined broadly in the text, which features a mindful exploration of seven ethnic groupings, inclusive of all people within dominant and non-dominant cultural groups. The extensively revised <strong>Third Edition </strong>includes two new chapters on counseling immigrants and refugees and counseling military populations, exposing students to complex cultural developments.

What is the value of history? What is the use of history? How do scholars attempt to unpack it and make connections in a responsible manner? <br> &nbsp;<br> While the topics of historiography and historical methodology have become increasingly popular, Bloch remains an authority. He argues that history is a whole; no period and no topic can be understood except in relation to other periods and topics. And what is unique about Bloch is that he puts his theories into practice; for example, calling upon both his experience serving in WWI as well as his many years spent in peaceful study and reflection. He also argues that written records are not enough; a historian must draw upon maps, place-names, ancient tools, aerial surveys, folklore, and everything that is available. <br> &nbsp;<br> This is a work that argues constantly for a wider, more human history. For a history that describes how and why people live and work together. There is a living, breathing connection between the past and the present and it is the historian&#x2019;s responsibility to do it justice.</p><p>Reflection on the nature and uses of History and the Techniques and Methods of those who write it.Marc Bloch was a French historian who cofounded the Annales School of French social history.

How does the economic and social instability left in the wake of neoliberalism shape their identities, their understandings of the American Dream, and their futures?<br><br><em>Coming Up Short </em>illuminates the transition to adulthood for working-class men and women. Moving away from easy labels such as the "Peter Pan generation," Jennifer Silva reveals the far bleaker picture of how the erosion of traditional markers of adulthood-marriage, a steady job, a house of one's own-has changed what it means to grow up as part of the post-industrial working class. Based on one hundred interviews with working-class people in two towns-Lowell, Massachusetts, and Richmond, Virginia-Silva sheds light on their experience of heightened economic insecurity, deepening inequality, and uncertainty about marriage and family. Silva argues that, for these men and women, coming of age means coming to terms with the absence of choice. As possibilities and hope contract, moving into adulthood has been re-defined as a process of personal struggle-an adult is no longer someone with a small home and a reliable car, but someone who has faced and overcome personal demons to reconstruct a transformed self. Indeed, rather than turn to politics to restore the traditional working class, this generation builds meaning and dignity through the struggle to exorcise the demons of familial abuse, mental health problems, addiction, or betrayal in past relationships. This dramatic and largely unnoticed shift reduces becoming an adult to solitary suffering, self-blame, and an endless seeking for signs of progress. <br><br>This powerfully written book focuses on those who are most vulnerable-young, working-class people, including African-Americans, women, and single parents-and reveals what, in very real terms, the demise of the social safety net means to their fragile hold on the American Dream.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jennifer M. Silva</strong> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Bucknell University.<br><br>"Impeccably researched and skillfully articulated, Silva's work is a timely primer on the current state of blue-collar Millennials." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><br><p></p><br>"In the tradition of Studs Terkel's <em>Working and Lillian Rubin's Worlds of Pain</em>, this poignant and powerful book takes us inside the lives of today's working class. With remarkable empathy and painful detail, Silva illuminates the personal stories of young workers with no unions, no pensions, no assets, and little hope for more than unstable low-wage jobs. Rather than blaming neoliberal capitalism for their precarious futures, she finds that these young people blame themselves. A smart and compelling page-turner, <em>Coming Up Short</em> is a truly masterful work." --Sharon Hays, author of <em>Flat</em> <em>Broke with Children</em> <br><p></p><br>"Capitalism and its devastating effects are best examined at the bottom of the social order, where men and women struggle with unemployment, with intimacy, and with forming self-respect. <em>Coming Up Short</em> studies working-class lives from a new perspective: that of the management of risk. It is a masterful contribution to our understanding of how capitalism creates the many anxieties that make up our lives." --Eva Illouz, Professor of Sociology, Hebrew University, Jerusalem <br><p></p><br>"This outstanding book offers a heartbreaking account of America's 21st century working class as they transition to adulthood. Dreaming of a life of college education, steady well-paying jobs, marriage, home-ownership, and children, they confront a reality of student loan debt, low-paying service sector jobs, unstable relationships, and a changed landscape of individual risk and self-blame. Silva's extraordinary ability to connect with these young people brings their perspectives to life, and her sharp analyses link their lives to wider social currents. Written with a rare combination of empathy and clear-eyed reasoning, Silva exemplifies sociology at its very best. This should be required reading for every young adult in America, and everyone who loves a young adult." --Mary Waters, M.E. Zukerman Professor of Sociology, Harvard University <br><p></p><br>"If you care about our country's future, ponder the compelling personal histories that Jennifer Silva portrays in this impressive book. Silva describes with grace and sensitivity how the economic and social changes that have rocked America in the last half century reverberate in the lives of young working class adults, radically isolated and striving to craft a sense of self in a world without security, without solidarity, and without trust. It is a chastening tale." --Robert D. Putnam, Professor of Public Policy, Harvard University, and author of <em>Bowling Alone</em><p></p><br>"[A] brief yet devastating book that blends academic analysis and oral history to put a new face on well-documented trends that are more usually described in the abstract." --<em>Boston Globe</em> <br><p></p><br>"Silva has made a major contribution to understanding where young adults are coming from, what influences them, and what they consider to be common sense." --<em>The American Conservative</em> <br><p></p><br>"Fascinating" --<em>Feministing.com</em> <br><p></p><br>"[A]n enjoyable read and raises important issues that we generally overlook." --<em>Washington Independent Review of Books</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Coming Up Short</em> is a brief, but powerful, update of the status, difficulties, behaviors and distresses that characterize the lives of young working class adults. Based on in-depth interviews with 100 subjects, both White and African American, the book is -- among other things -- a reminder of the power of qualitative research, where the subjects' statements and the vignettes about them poignantly document a number of themes in a way that statistical tables could not... <em>Coming Up Short</em> is highly recommended for sociologists and social welfare students and academics alike. It informs in telling detail the difficult circumstances and self-perceptions of a significant portion of the American population. It is also a window into how the 'helping professions' have influenced the thinking of young adults and suggests that those professions need help their clients see their troubles in broader terms than they apparently currently do." --<em>Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare</em> <br><p></p><br>"I enjoyed reading this book. It will stay in my memory long after it returns to my bookshelf, although I suspect it will not stay there long. For sociologists of youth and adulthood, like me, it contains many insights that spur the sociological imagination. But above all, the young working-class lives that Silva enables us to hear will continue to haunt me. They may be "coming up short" in an economic and social system that promises much, yet often delivers little, but to my mind and throughout Silva's book, they are adults with important messages to convey and lives to lead." --<em>American</em> <em>Journal of Sociology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Travell and Simons&#39; Trigger Point Flip Charts</h2><p>Volumes 1 and 2 of Drs.

Active in mid-fifteenth-century Florence, he was an architect, theorist, and author of texts on perspective and painting. Alberti&#39;s On Painting is a cardinal work that revolutionized Western art. In this volume, Rocco Sinisgalli presents a new English translation and critical examination of Alberti&#39;s seminal text. Dr. Sinisgalli reverses the received understanding of the relationship between the Italian and Latin versions of Alberti&#39;s treatise by demonstrating that Alberti wrote it first in Italian and then translated it into a polished Latin over the course of several decades. This volume is richly illustrated to help demonstrate how Alberti understood optics and art.</p><p>Leon Battista Alberti&#39;s On Painting is a cardinal work that revolutionized Western art.

Engaging with the interdisciplinary enterprise of environmental history, it examines the way in which natural forces affected people, how people changed their surroundings, and how they thought about the world around them. Exploring key themes in medieval history - including the decline of Rome, religious doctrine, and the long fourteenth century - Hoffmann draws fresh conclusions about enduring questions regarding agrarian economies, tenurial rights, technology and urbanization. Revealing the significance of the natural world on events previously thought of as purely human, the book explores issues including the treatment of animals, sustainability, epidemic disease and climate change, and by introducing medieval history in the context of social ecology, brings the natural world into historiography as an agent and object of history itself.</p><p>How did medieval Europeans use and change their environments, think about the natural world, and handle the natural forces affecting their lives? This is a pioneering survey of medieval relations with the natural world which integrates approaches from social and economic history and environmental studies.Richard Hoffmann is Professor Emeritus and Senior Scholar at the Department of History, York University, Canada. As a pioneer in the environmental history of pre-industrial Europe, he is widely known for his contributions to medieval studies, environmental studies and historic fisheries.</p><h2>Neurobiology and the Development of Human Morality: Evolution, Culture, and Wisdom (Norton Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology)</h2><p><p><strong><strong>Winner of the Inaugural Expanded Reason Award:</strong> A wide-ranging exploration of the role of childhood experiences in adult morality.</strong></p> Moral development has traditionally been considered a matter of reasoning&#x2015;of learning and acting in accordance with abstract rules. On this model, largely taken for granted in modern societies, acts of selfishness, aggression, and ecological mindlessness are failures of will, moral problems that can be solved by acting in accordance with a higher rationality. But both ancient philosophy and recent scientific scholarship emphasize implicit systems, such as action schemas and perceptual filters that guide behavior and shape human development. In this integrative book, Darcia Narvaez argues that morality goes &#x201c;all the way down&#x201d; into our neurobiological and emotional development, and that a person&#x2019;s moral architecture is largely established early on in life. Moral rationality and virtue emerge &#x201c;bottom up&#x201d; from lived experience, so it matters what that experience is. Bringing together deep anthropological history, ethical philosophy, and contemporary neurobiological science, she demonstrates where modern industrialized societies have fallen away from the cultural practices that made us human in the first place.<br><br><em>Neurobiology and the Development of Human Morality</em> advances the field of developmental moral psychology in three key ways. First, it provides an evolutionary framework for early childhood experience grounded in developmental systems theory, encompassing not only genes but a wide array of environmental and epigenetic factors. Second, it proposes a neurobiological basis for the development of moral sensibilities and cognition, describing ethical functioning at multiple levels of complexity and context before turning to a theory of the emergence of wisdom. Finally, it embraces the sociocultural orientations of our ancestors and cousins in small-band hunter-gatherer societies&#x2015;the norm for 99% of human history&#x2015;for a re-envisioning of moral life, from the way we value and organize child raising to how we might frame a response to human-made global ecological collapse.<br><br> Integrating the latest scholarship in clinical sciences and positive psychology, Narvaez proposes a developmentally informed ecological and ethical sensibility as a way to self-author and revise the ways we think about parenting and sociality. The techniques she describes point towards an alternative vision of moral development and flourishing, one that synthesizes traditional models of executive, top-down wisdom with &#x201c;primal&#x201d; wisdom built by multiple systems of biological and cultural influence from the ground up.</p><p><p><strong>Darcia Narvaez</strong>, PhD, is Professor of Psychology at the University of Notre Dame specializing in ethical development and moral education, and a fellow of the American Psychological Association.

My colleagues and I left our day with Barry with full hearts and high spirits, ready to bring new strategies and new energy into our writing workshops."</p>Twenty-five years ago, Barry Lane s first edition of After THE END changed the way I taught writing. Updated with new lessons, this second edition is even better a must for teachers looking for ways to get their students beyond one and done writing and into deeper levels of revision. After the End is my favorite book on teaching students the art of revision, and it should be part of every writing teacher s professional library. --Kelly Gallagher<br><br>Barry Lane's After the End is truly a book for all writing teachers. It is a strategy-packed resource that ripples with Barry s ingenious word play and his wise guidance for teachers.

Barry shows not just how to teach but why to gives students myriad ways to finesse their writing. After the End will help you uncover the voice and the creative energy in your own writing and in your teaching. You must have this book. Penny Kittle<br><br> In After THE END, Barry Lane leads us to revitalize our thinking about revision, helping us to understand how revision is an essential and joyful part of the processes of writing and learning. Barry offers an eclectic assortment of invitations to engage in revision, in the form of teacher tips, tasks for student writers, instructive samples of writing, interviews with a variety of experts, helpful texts, and on-line resources. Throughout the book, Barry takes on contemporary distortions in writing instruction as he reminds us that revision is meant, above all, to help writers convey their truths. --Kathy Collins<br><br>After the End should be titled At the Beginning. This classic, now more relevant and engaging than ever, should be the writing book teachers go to before they even think about their writing instruction. Barry Lane, never one for simply telling, shows through examples, interviews, snapshots, and classroom scenarios that writing is so much more than a test prompt, an assignment, or a formula for argument and exposition. If you loved the first edition, you will devour the second. If you are new to Barry's work, get ready for a writing transformation that will change your classroom. . .and your notions about what it means to teach. ReLeah Lent<br><br> After reading the first edition of After THE END, I came to understand the central role revision plays in the writing process. As a classroom teacher, Barry s original book helped me reconsider every aspect of my writing workshop. With this new edition, Barry asks us to reconsider the work we do as teachers of writing. Barry s gentle advice is peppered with his sense of humor, practical suggestions, and thoughtful instructional approaches. This new edition will surely end up dog-eared on every teacher s desk as they mark the ideas they will be able to use to support their students as writers. After THE END is a treasure trove of resources and lesson ideas easily adaptable to any educational setting. --Frank Serafini</p><h2>Concise History of Haitian Revolution</h2><p>This book offers students a concise and clearly written overview of the events of the Haitian Revolution, from the slave uprising in the French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1791 to the declaration of Haiti&#x2019;s independence in 1804.<br> <br> <ul> <li>Draws on the latest scholarship in the field as well as the author&#x2019;s original research</li> <li>Offers a valuable resource for those studying independence movements in Latin America, the history of the Atlantic World, the history of the African diaspora, and the age of the American and French revolutions</li> <li>Written by an expert on both the French and Haitian revolutions to offer a balanced view</li> <li>Presents a chronological, yet thematic, account of the complex historical contexts that produced and shaped the Haitian Revolution</li> </ul></p><p>The Haitian Revolution was the only successful slave revolt in world history and the first time people of color overthrew a European colonial regime to establish an independent country.

Some critics have explained the failure of social programs by citing our tradition of individual freedom and libertarian values, while others point to weaknesses within the working class. In <em>The Color of Welfare</em>, Jill Quadagno takes exception to these claims, placing race at the center of the "American Dilemma," as Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal did half a century ago. The "American creed" of liberty, justice, and equality clashed with a history of active racial discrimination, says Quadagno. It is racism that has undermined the War on Poverty, and America must come to terms with this history if there is to be any hope of addressing welfare reform today.<br> From Reconstruction to Lyndon Johnson and beyond, Quadagno reveals how American social policy has continually foundered on issues of race. Drawing on extensive primary research, Quadagno shows, for instance, how Roosevelt, in need of support from southern congressmen, excluded African Americans from the core programs of the Social Security Act. Turning to Lyndon Johnson's "unconditional war on poverty," she contends that though anti-poverty programs for job training, community action, health care, housing, and education have accomplished much, they have not been fully realized because they became inextricably intertwined with the civil rights movement of the 1960s, which triggered a white backlash. Job training programs, for instance, became affirmative action programs, programs to improve housing became programs to integrate housing, programs that began as community action to upgrade the quality of life in the cities were taken over by local civil rights groups. This shift of emphasis eventually alienated white, working-class Americans, who had some of the same needs--for health care, subsidized housing, and job training opportunities--but who got very little from these programs. At the same time, affirmative action clashed openly with organized labor, and equal housing raised protests from the white suburban middle-class, who didn't want their neighborhoods integrated. Quadagno shows that Nixon, who initially supported many of Johnson's programs, eventually caught on that the white middle class was disenchanted. He realized that his grand plan for welfare reform, the Family Assistance Plan, threatened to undermine wages in the South and alienate the Republican party's new constituency--white, southern Democrats--and therefore dropped it.<br> In the 1960s, the United States embarked on a journey to resolve the "American dilemma." Yet instead of finally instituting full democratic rights for all its citizens, the policies enacted in that turbulent decade failed dismally. <em>The Color of Welfare</em> reveals the root cause of this failure--the inability to address racial inequality.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jill Quadagno</strong> is Professor of Sociology and Mildred and Claude Pepper Chair in Social Gerontology at Florida State University. She is the author of <em>The Transformation of Old Age Security</em>.<br>A pointed reinterpretation of the history of antipoverty policy, arguing that racism most explains why our welfare state is feeble compared with other industrialized nations. Quadagno (Sociology/Florida State Univ.; The Transformation of Old Age Security, not reviewed) proceeds with several case studies, which could have used a bit of leavening with political context and journalistic verve. The author notes that black agricultural workers and domestic servants were denied Social Security protection because of white political opposition in the Roosevelt era. Similarly, New Deal programs seeking to bolster the housing market actually reinforced housing segregation. The Office of Economic Opportunity, the main engine of Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, didn't receive enough funding, nor did it establish a policy of redistribution, the author notes. Her discussion of government job-training programs and affirmative action, in which she attacks William Julius Wilson's well-known critique of group rights, is not fully convincing; nor does it address some latter- day issues like the ``race-norming'' of job tests. More potent is her analysis of federal housing policy, which in the 1980s retreated from its commitment to subsidizing housing for the poor. Also, she shows how Richard Nixon's Family Assistance Plan, which promised a guaranteed annual income to the poor, threatened Southern political and business powers, who led the political opposition. She does suggest that the country's lack of commitment to universal child care can be blamed less on racism than on general social conservatism. In the end, Quadagno establishes that the US, compared to other industrialized nations, does the least to fight poverty.

How do psychologists identify and address ethical issues? What are the most important ethical concepts, and how do they apply to specific settings?<br><br> This one-of-a-kind book acculturates the reader into ethical practice in psychology by enhancing critical thinking skills. Rather than explain each of the 80+ standards of the APA Ethics Code, the book examines the code's underlying principles.<br><br> The book begins with a basic introduction to the code, including a brief history and an overview of general concepts. Next, it explores in depth four ethical concepts applicable to all psychologists: competence; informed consent; privacy and confidentiality; avoiding harm and exploitation.<br><br> Finally, it shows how these key concepts apply to specific psychologist roles, including assessment, treatment, research and publication, and teaching and supervision.<br><br> Numerous case studies show how ethical concepts are applied, and a supplemental web site provides discussion questions, a reading list, and extensive other materials to enhance the reader's learning.<br><br> This book is essential reading for psychology students in high school, undergraduate school, and graduate school, as well as licensed psychologists who want to improve their ethical decision-making skills and reduce their liability in professional practice.</p><p>This text introduces students to the APA Ethics Code.

A lively introduction to the subject, this textbook is intended for undergraduates with relatively little background in linguistics. Providing data from a wide variety of languages, it includes hands-on activities such as &#39;challenge&#39; boxes, designed to encourage students to gather their own data and analyze it, work with data on websites, perform simple experiments, and discuss topics with each other. There is also an extensive introduction to the terms and concepts necessary for analyzing words. Unlike other textbooks it anticipates the question &#39;is it a real word?&#39; and tackles it head on by looking at the distinction between dictionaries and the mental lexicon. This second edition has been thoroughly updated, including new examples and exercises as well as a detailed introduction to using linguistic corpora to find and analyze morphological data.</p><p>A lively introduction to morphology (how words are put together), this textbook is intended for undergraduates with relatively little background in linguistics.

With the ever-growing popularity of sushi restaurants across the country, however, seaweed is becoming a substantial part of our total food intake. And even as we dine with delight on maki, miso soup, and seaweed salads, very few of us have any idea of the nutritional value of seaweed. Here celebrated scientist Ole G. Mouritsen, drawing on his fascination with and enthusiasm for Japanese cuisine, champions seaweed as a staple food while simultaneously explaining its biology, ecology, cultural history, and gastronomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouritsen takes readers on a comprehensive tour of seaweed, describing what seaweeds actually are (algae, not plants) and how people of different cultures have utilized them since prehistoric times for a whole array of purposes&#x2014;as food and fodder, for the production of salt, in medicine and cosmetics, as fertilizer, in construction, and for a number of industrial end uses, to name just a few. He reveals the vast abundance of minerals, trace elements, proteins, vitamins, dietary fiber, and precious polyunsaturated fatty acids found in seaweeds, and provides instructions and recipes on how to prepare a variety of dishes that incorporate raw and processed seaweeds. Approaching the subject from not only a gastronomic but also a scientific point of view, Mouritsen sets out to examine the past and present uses of this sustainable resource, keeping in mind how it could be exploited for the future. Because seaweeds can be cultivated in large quantities in the ocean in highly sustainable ways, they are ideal for battling hunger and obesity alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hundreds of delectable illustrations depicting the wealth of species, colors, and shapes of seaweed, <i>Seaweeds: Edible, Available, and Sustainable </i>makes a strong case for granting these &#x201c;vegetables from the sea&#x201d; a prominent place in our kitchens.</p><p><b>Ole G. Mouritsen</b> is professor of biophysics at the University of Southern Denmark. His previous books include <i>Life&#x2014;As a Matter of Fat</i> and <i>Sushi: Food for the Eye, the Body and the Soul</i>.&#x201c;A well-written presentation for the general reader of an underused resource, this volume fills a niche among seaweed cookbooks such as J. Gusman&#x2019;s <i>Vegetables from the Sea</i>, specialized scientific treatises (C. Wiencke&#x2019;s <i>Seaweed Biology</i>), and field guides to the seaweed of specific locales.&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Seaweeds&nbsp;</i>is&nbsp;not quite an academic book, not quite a field guide, and not quite a cookbook&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the best of all worlds.&#x201d; (<i>theKitchn</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[A] beautifully illustrated guide for the non-specialist to the immense nutritional, medicinal, industrial and environmental properties of seaweed. A passionate evangelist&#x2014;and self-confessed obsessive&#x2014;Mouritsen has travelled the world in his search for the &#x2018;seaweed people&#x2019; who make their lives out of this astonishing stuff.&#x201d; (<i>Spectator</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A very approachable and rather enjoyable read. . . . As you look at the photos, it&#x2019;s hard to deny the surprising physical beauty to all the edible marine algae. And you&#x2019;ll marvel at the tasting notes Mouritsen provides. Of course, for food lovers interested in actually preparing seaweeds, Mouritsen shares with readers a number of recipes, including Miso, St. Patrick&#x2019;s Cabbage Soup (using carrageen), Guacamole with Dried Seaweeds, and Seaweed Pesto. There&#x2019;s a lot to admire about <i>Seaweeds</i>, and much that it has to offer.&#x201d; (<i>Epicurious</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Seaweeds</i> is an excellent book, deserving the serious attention of marine resource managers&#x2014;and certainly also, that of the more adventurous seaside cook.&#x201d; (Richard Shelton <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[Mouritsen&#x2019;s] immense knowledge and enthusiasm are . . . imparted in a series of fascinating chapters that encompass biology, cultural history, ecology, medicine, and cookery. . . .

Used by home schoolers and charter, public and private school students world-wide for over ten years, Friendly Chemistry presents what is often considered an intimidating subject as a genuinely fun, enjoyable experience. Whether you&#39;re a high-school aged student needing a lab science course or a &#34;non-traditional&#34; student looking for a refresher course to help you prepare for an upcoming entrance exam, Friendly Chemistry can help you accomplish your goal in a &#34;painless&#34; way! If you do have aspirations of a future in a science field, Friendly Chemistry can give you the solid foundation you need to succeed in subsequent courses. Friendly Chemistry was written using simple language and a host of analogies to make learning (and teaching!) chemistry easy. The chemistry concepts presented in Friendly Chemistry are NOT watered-down. The concepts are just explained in ways that are readily understood by most learners. Coupled with these explanations is a host of teaching aids, labs and games which makes the learning concrete and multi-sensory. Students find the course fun and painless. Parents often comment, &#34;I wish I had had this when I was taking chemistry. Now it all makes so much sense!&#34; Friendly Chemistry covers the same topics taught in traditional high school chemistry courses. The course begins with an introduction to atomic theory followed by discussion of why the elements are arranged the way they are in the periodic table.

The book summarizes and integrates a broad range of research in psychology and related scientific fields. In the last 40 years, psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists have devoted increased attention to creativity; we now know more about creativity than at any point in history. <em>Explaining Creativity</em> considers not only arts like painting and writing, but also science, stage performance, business innovation, and creativity in everyday life. <br><br>Sawyer's approach is interdisciplinary. In addition to examining psychological studies on creativity, he draws on anthropologists' research on creativity in non-Western cultures, sociologists' research on the situations, contexts, and networks of creative activity, and cognitive neuroscientists' studies of the brain. He moves beyond the individual to consider the social and cultural contexts of creativity, including the role of collaboration in the creative process.<br></p><p>Dr. Keith Sawyer is one of the world's leading scientific experts on creativity, innovation, and learning.

In <em>Seneca Falls and the</em> <em>Origins of the Women's Rights Movement</em>, Sally McMillen reveals, for the first time, the full significance of that revolutionary convention and the enormous changes it produced. The book covers 50 years of women's activism, from 1840 to 1890, focusing on four extraordinary figures--Mott, Stanton, Lucy Stone, and Susan B. Anthony. McMillen tells the stories of their lives, how they came to take up the cause of women's rights, the astonishing advances they made during their lifetimes, and the far-reaching effects of the work they did. At the convention they asserted full equality with men, argued for greater legal rights, greater professional and education opportunities, and the right to vote--ideas considered wildly radical at the time. Indeed, looking back at the convention two years later, Anthony called it "the grandest and greatest reform of all time."<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Sally McMillen</strong> is the Mary Reynolds Babcock Professor of History and Department Chair at Davidson College.

In the first half of the book, I thought: &#x2018;This is the best and deepest diagnosis of what&#x2019;s wrong with American evangelicalism I&#x2019;ve ever read.&#x2019; In the second half, I thought, &#x2018;This is one of the most moving accounts of Jesus&#x2019; humanity and death I&#x2019;ve ever read.&#x2019; This book will stay with me for a long time.&#x201d; (Brian McLaren, author of A New Kind of Christianity and Naked Spirituality) &#x201c;Doug Frank is kind and gracious and dangerous and fearless and honest &#x2013; all at the same time. This book will help lots of people find liberation from the malevolent Being they never believed in in the first place.&#x201d; (Rob Bell, author of Love Wins) &#x201c;The gentleness with which Doug Frank deconstructs the Almighty of popular preaching and the schizoid salvation story of America&#x2019;s patriarchs could not be more respectful of the God of infinite love, the forgiveness of Jesus and the evangelical tradition itself.&#x201d; (David James Duncan, author of The Brothers K) &#x201c;A Gentler God is a fascinating insight into the psychology of evangelicalism and the men who gave shape to it. Doug Frank carefully, lovingly uncovers the emotional damage that can result from clinging to a magical almighty deity, when our souls might be saved by the messy and merciful Jesus.&#x201d; (Debbie Blue, pastor at House of Mercy, St. Paul, MN, author of Sensual Orthodoxy) &#x201c;A Gentler God is a rich ragout of theology, American church history, pop culture, scripture, and psychology... Frank&#x2019;s book is compelling because of Frank&#x2019;s own gentleness &#x2013; gentleness that has conviction and energy.... One senses that this book is a life-work, an outcome of a long, patient journey where enough time has passed and enough wisdom been gained for sour grapes to have become sweet and nourishing.&#x201d; (Perspectives) &#x201d;Narrating extensive stories of his own spiritual pilgrimage away from ... the wrathful God of his youth and recounting experiences of others who have been wounded by their experiences in evangelical families, churches and colleges, Frank develops a full-scale psychological interpretation of evangelical pathologies and a full-scale theology to remedy those pathologies.&#x201d; (Christian Century) Product Description What is God like? Is God the lofty Almighty of conservative religion, with power to stop human holocausts and deadly natural disasters, but who inexplicably declines to do so? Is God the callous Judge, offering his favorites a place in heaven while summarily casting the damned into everlasting hell? Is God the vain King on his throne, requiring us to stroke his ego by praising him unceasingly for his awesome power? If this is the God we&#x2019;ve been taught, no wonder so many have come to realize that they don&#x2019;t like &#x2013; let alone trust &#x2013; God. The simple certainties of their childhood no longer make sense. But the equally assured assertions of today&#x2019;s atheists leave them cold. They want a personal connection with God &#x2013; an honest faith that grows out of their own felt truth and touches them at the deepest levels of their being.</p><p></p><h2>White Mother to a Dark Race: Settler Colonialism, Maternalism, and the Removal of Indigenous Children in the American West and Australia, 1880-1940</h2><p>In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, indigenous communities in the United States and Australia suffered a common experience at the hands of state authorities: the removal of their children to institutions in the name of assimilating American Indians and protecting Aboriginal people. Although officially characterized as benevolent, these government policies often inflicted great trauma on indigenous families and ultimately served the settler nations&#x2019; larger goals of consolidating control over indigenous peoples and their lands. <br><i>White Mother to a Dark Race</i> takes the study of indigenous education and acculturation in new directions in its examination of the key roles white women played in these policies of indigenous child-removal. Government officials, missionaries, and reformers justified the removal of indigenous children in particularly gendered ways by focusing on the supposed deficiencies of indigenous mothers, the alleged barbarity of indigenous men, and the lack of a patriarchal nuclear family. Often they deemed white women the most appropriate agents to carry out these child-removal policies. Inspired by the maternalist movement of the era, many white women were eager to serve as surrogate mothers to indigenous children and maneuvered to influence public policy affecting indigenous people. Although some white women developed caring relationships with indigenous children and others became critical of government policies, many became hopelessly ensnared in this insidious colonial policy.</p><p>Margaret D.

This new masterpiece, a haunting story of love and treason, invites us not only into the secret places of Britain&#x2019;s power but also into the innermost sanctums of the fin de si��cle Austro-Hungarian Empire.Thomas Pitt, once a lowly policeman, is now the powerful head of Britain&#x2019;s Special Branch, and some people fear that he may have been promoted beyond his abilities. He, too, feels painful moments of self-doubt, especially as rumors reach him of a plot to blow up connections on the Dover-London rail line on which Austrian duke Alois Habsburg is soon to travel to visit his royal English kin.Why would anyone destroy an entire train to kill one obscure Austrian royal, or are the rumors designed to distract Pitt from an even more devastating plot?

Anne Perry lives in Scotland.chapter<br><br>1<br><br>It was mid-february and growing dark outside. Pitt stood up from his desk and walked over to turn the gas up on the wall lamps one by one. He was becoming used to this office, even if he was not yet comfortable in it. In his mind it still belonged to Victor Narraway.<br><br>When he turned back to his desk he half expected to see the pencil drawings of bare trees that Narraway used to keep on the walls, instead of the watercolors of skies and seascapes that Charlotte had given him. His books were not so different from Narraway&#x2019;s. There was less poetry, fewer classics perhaps, but similar titles on history, politics, and law.<br><br>Narraway had of course taken with him the large, silver-framed picture of his mother. Today, Pitt had finally put in its place his favorite photograph of his family. In it, Charlotte is smiling; beside her stands thirteen-year-old Jemima, looking very grown-up, and ten-year-old Daniel, still with the soft face of a child.<br><br>After the fiasco in Ireland at the end of last year, 1895, Narraway had not been reinstated as head of Special Branch, though he had been exonerated of all charges, of course. Instead, Pitt&#x2019;s temporary status as head had been made official. Even though it had happened several months earlier, he still found it hard to get used to. And he knew very well that the men who had once been his superiors, then his equals, and now his juniors, also found the new situation trying at best. Rank, in and of itself, meant little. His title commanded obedience, but not loyalty.<br><br>So far they had obeyed him without question. But he had had several months of very predictable events to deal with. There had been only the usual rumblings of discontent among the various immigrant populations, particularly here in London, but no crises. None of the difficult situations that endangered lives and tested his judgment. If such a crisis were to occur, it was then, he suspected, that he might find his men&#x2019;s trust in him strained and tenuous.<br><br>Pitt stopped by the window, staring out at the pattern of the opposite rooftops and the elegant wall of the nearby building, just able to discern their familiar outlines in the fading light. The bright gleam of streetlamps was increasing in all directions.<br><br>He pictured Narraway&#x2019;s grave face as it had been when they last spoke: tired and deeply lined, the effect of his difficult escape from total disgrace and from the emotional toll of his experiences in Ireland. Pitt knew that Narraway had accepted, at last, the existence of his feelings for Charlotte; but as always, Victor&#x2019;s coal-black eyes had given little away as they talked.<br><br>&#x201c;You will make mistakes,&#x201d; he had said to Pitt in the quietness of this room, with its view of sky and rooftops. &#x201c;You will hesitate to act when you know it could hurt people or destroy a life. Do not hesitate too long. You will misjudge people; you&#x2019;ve always thought better of your social superiors than you should have. For God&#x2019;s sake, Pitt, rely on your instincts. Sometimes the results of your decisions will be serious. Live with it. The measure of your worth is what you learn from the errors you make. You cannot opt out; that would be the worst mistake of all.&#x201d; His face had been grim, shadowed by memories. &#x201c;It is not only the decision you make that counts, but that you make it at the right moment. Anything that threatens the peace and safety of Britain can come under your jurisdiction.&#x201d;<br><br>Narraway had not added &#x201c;God help you,&#x201d; though he might as well have. Then a dry humor had softened his eyes for a moment. Pitt had seen a flicker of compassion there for the burden that lay ahead, and also a hint of envy, regret for the excitement lost, the pounding of the blood and the fire of the mind that Narraway was being forced to give up.<br><br>Of course, Pitt had seen him since then, but only briefly. There had been social events here and there, conversations that were polite, but devoid of meaning beyond the courtesies. The questions as to how each of them was learning to bend, to adapt and alter his stride to a new role, remained unspoken.<br><br>Pitt sat down again at his desk and turned his attention to the papers in front of him.<br><br>There was a brief knock on the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The door opened at once, and Stoker entered. Thanks to the events in Ireland, he was the one man in the Branch that Pitt knew for certain he could trust.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; he said as Stoker came to stand in front of Pitt&#x2019;s desk. He looked worried and uncomfortable, his lean face more expressive than usual.<br><br>&#x201c;Got a report in from Hutchins in Dover, sir. Seen one or two unusual people coming over on the ferry. Troublemakers. Not the usual sort of political talkers&#x2014;more like the ones who really do things. He&#x2019;s pretty sure at least one of them was involved in the murder of the French prime minister the year before last.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt felt a knot tighten in his stomach. No wonder Stoker looked so worried. &#x201c;Tell him to do all he can to be absolutely sure of their identities,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Send Barker down as well. Watch the trains. We need to know if any of them come up to London, and who they contact if they do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It may be nothing,&#x201d; Stoker said without conviction. &#x201c;Hutchins is a bit jumpy.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt drew in his breath to say that it was Hutchins&#x2019;s job to be overcautious, then changed his mind. Stoker knew that as well as he did. &#x201c;Still, we should keep our eyes open. We&#x2019;ve enough men in Dover to do that, with Barker.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Stoker turned and left. Pitt sat without moving for a moment or two. If it really was one of the French prime minister&#x2019;s assassins, would the French police or secret service get in touch with him? Would they want his help, or prefer to deal with the man themselves? They might hope to get information about other anarchists from him. Or, on the other hand, they might simply contrive for him to meet with an accident, so the whole matter would never reach the public eye. If the latter were the case, it would be better if the British Special Branch pretended not to be aware of the situation. Pitt would have to make the decision about whether to involve the Special Branch, and to what extent, later, when he had more information. It was the type of decision Narraway had referred to: a gray area, fraught with moral difficulties.<br><br>Pitt bent back to the papers he had been reading.<br><br>There was a reception that evening. A hundred or so people of social and political importance would be gathered, ostensibly to hear the latest violin prodigy playing a selection of chamber pieces. In truth it would be a roomful of people attempting to observe and manipulate any shifts in political power, and to subtly exchange information that could not be passed in the more rigid settings of an office.<br><br>Pitt walked through the front door of his house in Keppel Street just after seven o&#x2019;clock, with plenty of time to get ready for the reception. He found himself smiling at the immediate warmth, a relief after the bitter wind outside. The familiar smells of baked bread and clean cotton drifted from the kitchen at the far end of the passage. Charlotte would be upstairs dressing. She was not yet used to being back in the glamour and rivalry of the high society into which she had been born. She had found it shallow when she was younger, and then, after marrying Pitt, it had been out of her reach. Now he knew, although she had never once said so, that at times she had missed the color and wit of it all, however superficial it was.<br><br>Minnie Maude was in the kitchen preparing Welsh rarebit for him, in case the refreshments at the event were meager. Her hair was flying out of its pins as usual, her face flushed with exertion, and perhaps a certain excitement. She swung around from the big stove as soon as she heard his footsteps.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Mr. Pitt, sir, &#x2019;ave yer seen Mrs. Pitt? She looks a proper treat, she does. I never seen anyone look so?.?.?.&#x201d; She was lost for words, so instead held out the plate of hot savory cheese on toast. Then, realizing the need for haste, she put it on the kitchen table, and fetched him a knife and fork. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get yer a nice cup o&#x2019; tea,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;Kettle&#x2019;s boiled.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said, hiding at least part of his amusement. Minnie Maude Mudway had replaced Gracie Phipps, the maid who had been with the Pitts almost since they were married. He was still not entirely used to the change. But Gracie had her own home now, and he was happy for her. Minnie Maude had been hired on Gracie&#x2019;s recommendation, and it was working out very satisfactorily, even if he missed Gracie&#x2019;s forthright comments about his cases, and her loyal and highly independent support.<br><br>He ate in silence, with considerable appreciation. Minnie Maude was rapidly becoming a good cook. With a more generous budget at her disposal than Gracie had ever had, she had taken to experimenting&#x2014;on the whole, with great success.<br><br>He noticed that she had made enough for herself, although her portion was much smaller. However, she seemed unwilling to eat it in front of him.<br><br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t wait,&#x201d; he said, gesturing toward the saucepan on the stove. &#x201c;Have it while it&#x2019;s hot.&#x201d;<br><br>She gave an uncertain smile and seemed about to argue, then changed her mind and served it. Almost at once she was distracted by a stack of clean dishes waiting to be put away in the Welsh dresser, and her meal went untouched. Pitt decided he should speak to Charlotte about it; perhaps she could say something to make Minnie Maude feel more comfortable. It was absurd for her to feel that she could not eat at the kitchen table just because he was there. Now that she had taken Gracie&#x2019;s place, this was her ho...</p><h2>Wodehouse Nuggets</h2><p>These nuggets from Wodehouse - phrases from his stories, wordplay, brilliant cameos of character -- are all pure gold, minted by our greatest comic writer.

A native Mainer, Roberts, whose historical novels include Northwest Passage and Arundel, was intrigued by the story of the December 1710 wreck of the Nottingham. After running aground a dozen miles offshore, the ship broke up, stranding her crew with minimal tools, scant shelter, and a few pieces of cheese. The men survived nearly a month of screeching gales, sub-freezing temperatures, and driving snowstorms. During their ordeal they resorted to cannibalism and were finally rescued after one of them made it ashore on a crude raft. Included here are contemporary accounts from crew members, offering dramatically different versions of the true-life traumatic event and a fascinating counterpoint to Roberts&#x2019; fictionalized version. A bestseller when published in 1956, Boon Island is a story of the ways that crisis can inspire the best--and worst--in human nature.</p><p>5 1/2 x 8 1/2 trim. Chart. Map.

Comic-book retailers, auctioneers, and conventioneers from around North America, as well as Green's collecting rivals, weigh in on the man and his vast collection of comic books. Are Green's intentions honorable? Does he truly love comics or is he driven by the need to conquer? Lastly, is he really even Wimbledon Green?</p><p>A charming and amusing caper where comic-book collecting is a world of intrigue and high finance. Part riotous chase, part whimsical character sketch, <i>Wimbledon Green </i>looks at the need to collect and the need to reinvent oneself.</p></p><p><p><b>Seth</b>'s comic-book series, <i>Palookaville</i>, has been collected into<i> It's a Good Life</i> and <i>Clyde Fans</i>. He is an illustrator for <i>The New Yorker</i> and the designer of the bestselling T<i>he Complete Peanuts</i>.</p>How did the world&#39;s greatest comic collector get to be so great? And what&#39;s with the hats? This whimsical creation from one-name cartoonist Seth works as both celebration and satire of the world of comic collectors. The titular Wimbledon Green is a roly-poly, mustached and bespectacled aesthete given to wearing suit and tie, a dandyish little cape, a small hat (he reportedly has boxes full) and carrying a cane. Described by many as the greatest comic book collector in the world (a label he can&#39;t dispute, thanks very much), he&#39;s alternately respected and hated by those in the world he inhabits. Seth sets up the story in documentary style, with talking heads given a page or two each to offer their version of what makes Green tick, how he came to have so much money that he could have such a massive collection and the possibly immoral means by which he obtained it. The world that Seth establishes here is hardly a realistic one, with Green residing in a house of castle-like proportions and shooting off to find rare editions in his personal gyrocopter. The cast of characters is small but colorful, mostly other collectors and some comic-store owners, all of whom have bones to pick with Wimbledon, who strides implacably through the whole controversy (stoked to hurricane-proportions by the passions of this small, insular community). Besides the satire which runs thickly behind each smartly rendered frame-there are a few jabs taken at the expense of nostalgists like Chris Ware and R. Crumb-there&#39;s a jaunty sense of adventure here, as Seth lays out his netherworld of collectors indulging in their ludicrous passions and intrigues. A humble hobby is pursued with Indiana Jones-style vigor.

With the revoking of NEA funding for such artists as Karen Finley, Tim Miller, and others, public awareness and media coverage of body-oriented performances have increased. Yet the roots of body art extend to the 1960s and before. In this definitive book, Amelia Jones explores body art projects from the 1960s and 1970s and relates their impact to the work of body artists active today, providing a new conceptual framework for defining postmodernism in the visual arts.</p><p>Jones begins with a discussion of the shifting intellectual terrain of the 1950s and 1960s, focusing on the work of Ana Mendieta. Moving to an examination of the reception of Jackson Pollock's "performative" acts of painting, she argues that Pollock is a pivotal figure between modernism and postmodernism. The book continues with explorations of Vito Acconci and Hannah Wilke, whose practices exemplify a new kind of performance that arose in the late 1960s, one that represents a dramatic shift in the conception of the artistic subject. Jones then surveys the work of a younger generation of artists -- including Laurie Anderson, Orlan, Maureen Connor, Lyle Ashton Harris, Laura Aguilar, and Bob Flanagan -- whose recent work integrates technology and issues of identity to continue to expand the critique begun in earlier body art projects.</p><p>Embracing an exhilarating mix of methodologies and perspectives (including feminism, queer theory, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and literary theory), this rigorous and elegantexamination of body art provides rich historical insight and essential context that rethinks the parameters of postmodern culture.</p></p><p>Amelia Jones is Grierson Chair in Art History and Communication Studies at McGill University.

He lives in Maryland.<br>Sharks are one of the most difficult fish to catch on a fly rod. Very small and blacktip sharks will attack almost any fly as they cruise bonefish flats. But as they get bigger, they seem to get smarter. Fortunately there is a surefire way to get a shark to hit your fly. Catch several ladyfish (the best fish to use as a decoy) or a catfish (which is very tough)--though any small dead fish can be used. Attach the dead fish to a length of thin rope or line and let it drag behind the boat as you drift along in waters that sharks inhabit. The juices and scent from the fish are very apparent to any nearby shark, which will move in to grab your decoy. Remember to keep a careful watch on the fish or the shark may steal it!<br><br>When you see a shark near the decoy fish, get ready to cast. (Remove th decoy immediately before the cast is made.) Orange-and-red or yellow-and-red flies appeal most to sharks, and they are easy to see. Remember, a shark's eyes are located well back on its head. If you cast directly in front of the shark, even if it sees the fly, the shark's nose may push it aside as it tries to grab your fly. You must cast the fly so that it lands and is retrieved near the eye of the shark. Since the amount of time the fly remains near the shark's eye is crucial, the boat's position and your own prior to the cast are important. If you cast to a shark that is going away from you, the fly, no matter how well placed, will zip by so quickly that the shark will either not see it or miss it on the strike. You need to approach the shark at such an angle that it swims toward you. Then you can make your cast and maintain the fly near its eye. As the shark moves close to the boat you should also kneel, because despite its poor vision the shark can still see a silhouette. And in stalking a big shark, silence is vital.<br></p><h2>The Warner Bros. Story: The Complete History of Hollywood&#39;s Great Studio Every Warner Bros.

In the past 500 years, millions of people have faced persecution, torture, and even death after being accused of practicing Witchcraft. <br> <br>For many people the word "Witch" still conjures up images of secret spells and diabolical midnight rituals. So what exactly is Witchcraft (also called Wica or Wicca), and how did it evolve into one of today's fastest-growing religions? <br> <br><i>Witchcraft From the Inside </i>presents the history of Witchcraft&#x2015;from its roots in ancient fertility religions, to the madness of the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> and the European Witch trials, to the growth of modern Wicca in Britain and the United States. Essays contributed by leading Wiccan authorities explore the present state of Wicca and provide a glimpse into the future of this peaceful nature religion. <br> <br>Author Ray Buckland studied Witchcraft under Gerald Gardner, the man largely credited for the revival of Witchcraft and the establishment of Wicca as a modern religion. Mr. Buckland was instrumental in bringing Gardnerian Witchcraft from England to the United States and is considered to be one of the leading American authorities on Witchcraft. <br> <br>In the following excerpt, Mr. Buckland explains the mundane truths behind the seemingly horrific ingredients of the legendary "witches' brews". <br> <br>We know, from Shakespeare and other sources, that the Witches threw into their pots the most gruesome ingredients, right? There were things like the tongue of a snake, bloody fingers, catgut, donkey's eyes, frog's foot, goat's beard, a Jew's ear, mouse tail, snake head, swine snout, wolf's foot, and so on. Pretty disgusting by the sound of it&#x2015;if you take them at face value! In fact these were all the most innocuous of ingredients: normal plants and herbs. <br>Today all plants have a Latin name, so that they may be distinct and positively identified. Yet years ago they were known only by common, local names. A plant or herb might be known by one name in one part of the country and a quite different name in another part of the country. And these names were colorful ones, frequently given to the plant because of its looks, color, or other attributes. <br>In the above list, adder's tongue was a name given to the dogtooth violet (<i>Erythronium americanum</i>); bloody fingers was the foxglove (<i>Digitalis purpurea</i>); catgut was the hoary pea (<i>Tephrosia virginiana</i>); donkey's eyes were the seeds of the cowage plant (<i>Mucuna pruriens</i>); frog's foot was the bulbous buttercup (<i>Ranunculus bulbosus</i>); goat's beard was the vegetable oyster (<i>Tragopogon porrofolius</i>); Jew's ear was a fungus that grew on elder trees and elm trees (<i>Peziza auricula</i>); mouse tail was common stonecrop (<i>Sedum acre</i>); snake head was balmony (<i>Chelone glabra</i>); swine snout was the dandelion (<i>Taraxacum dens leonis</i>); and wolf's foot was bugle weed (<i>Lycopus virginicus</i>). So the seemingly fearsome concoctions that the Witches mixed up in their cauldrons were nothing more than simple herbs going into a cookpot! <br></p><p>This is a complete history of witchcraft, including its origins in prehistory, its decline in the dark ages and its rebirth in the 20th century, as collected by an insider rather than a detached observer. I found the book to be well researched and documented, which more than did justice to the subject matter. While I enjoyed the information accumulated in a cover-to-cover reading, <b>Witchcraft from the Inside</b> is also a valuable reference tool.Author Ray Buckland really knows the truth about Witchcraft. He has publicly defended Witchcraft for more than three decades. He was the first person to introduce Gardnerian Wica into the United States, and created the first really new Wiccan system (Saxon) in 1973. He has written over thirty books books on Wicca, Voodoo, and the occult. <br> <br><i>Witchcraft From the Inside</i> is your complete guide to the past, present, and future of Witchcraft. See how the ancient pagan traditions developed over time and how they were forced underground with the rise of Christianity. Learn how the religion was resurrected in the 1950s, and why it grew and developed into one of the fastest-growing religions in the world. <br> <br>Once again, Ray has done an inestimable service for all Witches and Pagans. <i>Witchcraft From the Inside</i> is in invaluable resource for anyone interested in the real truth about Witchcraft. <br> <br></p><h2>Taste of Home Ground Beef Cookbook</h2><p>Ground meat is a popular staple of many recipes from meatloaf to pasta sauce to chili.

It was the kind of day that just made you want to pull the covers over your head and snooze all day. Like a vampire. It was the kind of day when guys and gals too hip to get cancer got all broken up because they couldn&#x2019;t work on their tans.<br> <br>Actually, sometimes Buffy thought it would be better if tans hadn&#x2019;t become as uncool as smoking. It&#x2019;d be a lot easier to tell the undead from the brain dead.<br> <br>Resolved to stay awake in first period, she forced her eyes open wider. Backpack over her shoulder, Buffy marched toward school, a little early as always. Well, not always. She was never even on time at her old school, but she was trying to reform. And besides, when she showed early, she got to hang with Willow and Xander for a few minutes before the whole grand delirium of the school day began.<br> <br>&#x201c;Happy Halloween!&#x201d; Xander cried as he caught up from behind.<br> <br>Buffy smiled slightly as he fell into step with her. &#x201c;Xander, isn&#x2019;t Halloween, like, prom night for ghouls? The night when, all over the world, the forces of darkness are set free for their annual block party?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, yeah, but it&#x2019;s all costumes and parties and trick-or-treat and&#x2014;,&#x201d; Xander began, but Buffy cut him off.<br> <br>&#x201c;And where do we live?&#x201d; she prodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, I get the point,&#x201d; he surrendered. &#x201c;But things have been pretty quiet lately, so I figured, why not be a little festive during my used-to-be-favorite-before-I-knew-all-this-stuff-was-real holiday?&#x201d;<br> <br>Buffy gave up. &#x201c;Happy Halloween to you, too, Xander.&#x201d; She winced inside. The last person she&#x2019;d offered season&#x2019;s greetings to had called her a thundering psycho.<br> <br>Xander Harris offered her a charming, crooked smile and pushed his somebody-get-me-a-comb hair away from his forehead. It seemed as if he wanted to say something more, but by then they had reached the bench where they met each morning. Willow was already there, her nose in a huge, dusty old book. The title was something about arcane rituals.<br> <br>Xander peered over her shoulder. &#x201c;Willow, dear Willow, you used to read such wholesome things.&#x201d; He feigned almost parental disapproval. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;ve just fallen in with the wrong crowd.&#x201d;<br> <br>Willow closed her book. &#x201c;Giles loaned it to me,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Fascinating stuff, actually. Apparently, there was this sixteenth-century alchemist who&#x2014;and you guys really don&#x2019;t want to hear this, anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>Buffy and Xander exchanged innocent looks&#x2014;Who, us? Not enraptured? But it would be a cold day in a place like, well, here, when they could put anything over on her. She tutored both of them in different subjects, was an Internet commando, and once in a while had to serve as Giles&#x2019;s translator, when the stuffy British librarian forgot he was speaking to people who hadn&#x2019;t spent their entire lives locked up in the Twilight Zone library.<br> <br>&#x201c;Happy Halloween, Willow,&#x201d; Buffy said warmly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, trick or treat, <i>chica</i>,&#x201d; Xander added.<br> <br>With her long, straight chestnut hair and sad eyes, Willow Rosenberg was every bit as sweet yet, um, inelegant as her name might suggest. But she and Xander were the best friends Buffy had ever had. They knew everything about her, about her being the Slayer, and they stuck by her. In fact, time and again, Willow and Xander put their lives on the line for her, and for the town.<br> <br>Buffy was the Chosen One. Slaying was her job. Willow and Xander did all the crazy stuff by choice. As far as Buffy was concerned, her friends were a lot braver than they ever gave themselves credit for.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Willow said as Buffy and Xander sat on the bench on either side of her. &#x201c;Halloween isn&#x2019;t a big deal anymore. I mean, when we were kids, we got to dress up and go trick-or-treating. Once you&#x2019;re in the double digits, it&#x2019;s so over. I think I&#x2019;m in mourning for my childhood, and I&#x2019;m only sixteen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Clone that,&#x201d; Buffy said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remember bobbing for apples at those killer Halloween parties your mom used to throw?&#x201d; Xander asked Willow, and she smiled at him.<br> <br>The two had known each other their whole lives, and Buffy had only come along this year. But they never made her feel left out, even when they talked about things they&#x2019;d shared in the past.<br> <br>&#x201c;I remember you trying to drown me while I was bobbing for apples,&#x201d; Willow replied, then turned to Buffy. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s amazing the selective memory guys have.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you know guys only tease girls when they&#x2019;re trying to get noticed,&#x201d; Buffy said, and raised an eyebrow.<br> <br>&#x201c;I noticed him when I was, like, five years old,&#x201d; Willow said under her breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting for him to notice I noticed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I loved those parties,&#x201d; Xander went on, oblivious to Willow&#x2019;s comments. &#x201c;I always used to win the pumpkin-carving contest. Big fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>He sighed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. Halloween sucks now. Even the horror movies on cable aren&#x2019;t as fun anymore, even since . . .&#x201d; He hesitated. &#x201c;Ah, ever since&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Buffy said, sighing. &#x201c;Ever since I came to town. I feel the same way. My mother and I used to watch all the classic fright flicks together and gorge ourselves on popcorn and leftover Halloween candy. Somehow I&#x2019;ve lost interest in the movies. Now we just gorge ourselves.&#x201d;<br> <br>Buffy felt a drop of rain on her arm and was about to mention it when Willow tapped her leg.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wicked witch and winged monkey at ten o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; she murmured.<br> <br>Buffy looked up to see Cordelia and her fan club about to pass by. Cordelia paid no attention to them, but Aphrodesia Kingsbury was with her, and Buffy glanced away as the girl spotted her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if it isn&#x2019;t my stalker,&#x201d; Aphrodesia sneered. &#x201c;I told them all about it, Buffy, so don&#x2019;t try to deny your after-hours bipolar wig out to anyone on campus.&#x201d; She glared at her. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there some kind of medication you&#x2019;re forgetting to take?&#x201d;<br> <br>Before Buffy could respond, Xander snapped angrily, &#x201c;Careful, Miss Twenty-Five-Watt. I wouldn&#x2019;t make Buffy mad if I were you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Xander,&#x201d; Buffy hissed, and Willow elbowed him in the stomach.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me? Are you threatening me?&#x201d; Aphrodesia said, zooming in like a heat-seeking missile on Xander. &#x201c;Because my sister&#x2019;s fianc� is in law school, and, like, he told me he would serve anybody I asked him to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, I&#x2019;d love it if he served me. I can&#x2019;t seem to get my own waiter&#x2019;s attention and we don&#x2019;t even have menus yet,&#x201d; Xander mocked. &#x201c;Good help. Hard to find. So.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, you people are so . . . <i>not</i>,&#x201d; Aphrodesia said, wrinkling her nose as if she&#x2019;d smelled something nasty. &#x201c;You two.&#x201d; She nodded toward Xander and Willow. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like Cordelia says. You&#x2019;re just run-of-the-mill losers. With a lot of effort, you might actually evolve into primates. But not if you loiter with Buffy. Her weirdness is like some brain-eating virus, and it&#x2019;s seriously infected your chances for a normal social life.&#x201d;<br> <br>By then, Cordelia and the rest of her crew had moved on, and Aphrodesia spun in a huff to follow.<br> <br>The three of them were quiet until the others were out of earshot. Then Willow turned to Xander with her eyebrows raised.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Xander asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss Twenty-Five-Watt?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Aphrodesia&#x2019;s not very bright,&#x201d; Xander explained. &#x201c;Twenty-five-watt. Get it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; Buffy and Willow said simultaneously.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who writes your stuff?&#x201d; Buffy asked, and the girls laughed together.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I thought it was funny,&#x201d; Xander mumbled snippily.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re just kidding, Xander,&#x201d; Willow said. &#x201c;You know we love you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good thing, or you&#x2019;d both be in deep can&#x2019;t-say-that-on-television,&#x201d; he replied menacingly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Witness our trembling,&#x201d; Buffy drawled.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have that effect on women,&#x201d; Xander announced.<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Willow said, &#x201c;you guys both coming to the Bronze tonight?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The masquerade! Wouldn&#x2019;t miss it!&#x201d; Xander said excitedly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going as Indiana Jones.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m so not surprised,&#x201d; Willow said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve dressed in that stupid hat every Halloween since you were nine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Xander stared at her, horrified, and Buffy stifled a laugh to save him from further embarrassment.<br> <br>&#x201c;If adventure has a name, my dear, it&#x2019;s Xander Harris,&#x201d; he said proudly. &#x201c;Well, actually, it&#x2019;s Harrison Ford, but women confuse the two of us all the time.&#x201d;<br> <br>They stared at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, it&#x2019;s happened a couple of times . . . once . . . okay, never, but we have kind of the same hair color,&#x201d; Xander explained. &#x201c;Brown. And my mom thinks I look like him. I suppose you two have a better costume idea for me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got one, but I&#x2019;ll tell you later,&#x201d; Willow said cryptically. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a surprise for Buffy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For me? I&#x2019;m an extreme no-show tonight,&#x201d; Buffy protested. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Slayer Super Bowl.&#x201d;<br> <br>Willow and Xander both frowned at her. For once, no snappy retorts. She was almost insulted, but then realized their silence was skeptical comment enough. Both of them knew that she&#x2019;d been bored out of her mind the past few weeks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, I am majorly sorry to have to blink and miss the masquerade, and I know you fun seekers think I&#x2019;m so wasting my time, but it&#x2019;s Halloween night,&#x201d; Buffy explained. &#x201c;I mean, so business has been a little slow&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Way slow,&#x201d; Willow corrected.<br> <br>&#x201c;Way slow,&#x201d; Buffy agreed. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s got to pick up tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You sound like you want it to pick up tonight,&#x201d; Xander said. &#x201c;I know compared to LA raves, a masquerade is tiny potatoes. But trust us, it&#x2019;s the most fun you can have in this agonizingly lame town.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Buffy,&#x201d; Willow pleaded. &#x201c;At least you can start out at the Bronze. If there&#x2019;s a gory emergency, you can always book.&#x201d;<br> <br>Buffy thought about it, but not for long. If she didn&#x2019;t start hanging with her friends more, they might adopt a new Slayer as their bud. Or not, since there weren&#x2019;t any others. One in every generation, that was Giles&#x2019;s favorite part of the Big Book of Slayage. But she still liked the idea of a quiet night at the Bronze.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll talk to Giles,&#x201d; Buffy decided. &#x201c;He still thinks this is all just the calm before the storm.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell him we&#x2019;ll take care of you,&#x201d; Xander suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;ll carry your bag o&#x2019; holy water and Xander will gas up the Batmobile,&#x201d; Willow said.<br> <br>As soon as the freedom bell rang, announcing that school was mercifully over for another day, Buffy was up and fighting through the swarm. In the hall, lockers clanged, gossip raged, girls shrieked, and guys laughed. She heard snippets of conversation, mostly about what people were wearing to the masquerade. There was mischief in the air, and a sense that anyone could burst into a fit of the giggles at any time. Halloween was such a kids&#x2019; holiday.<br> <br>But it hadn&#x2019;t always been that way. Giles was up on all the wicked history, but Buffy knew enough of it to know Halloween was made up to replace some kind of ancient death ritual or something. She&#x2019;d have to ask him. Actually, come to think of it, she probably wouldn&#x2019;t have to ask him. Giles didn&#x2019;t usually need to be asked to start lecturing. He just did.<br> <br>The hall traffic had started to thin. Buffy blew off her locker; she had everything she needed for the weekend in her backpack. Instead, she headed for the library to check in with Giles.<br> <br>Buffy was passing by the science lab when powerful hands with matted fur and yellow claws flashed out and snagged her by the shoulders. Out of the corner of her eye she saw the open jaws of the werewolf and reacted: a hard elbow to the ribs met with a satisfying grunt from behind. There was a roar in front of her, and Buffy looked up to see a second werewolf approaching. She straight-armed this one with the flat of her hand, knocking him on his butt, leaping high into an aerial roundhouse kick while her brain struggled frantically to send her a message: <i>Cease. Desist. Remember the cemetery, Buffy?</i><br> <br>Buffy pulled back on the kick and landed ungracefully on her behind. She glanced at the two &#x201c;werewolves,&#x201d; who she now realized were just big guys in full costume.<br> <br>&#x201c;Way to go, Jackie Chan,&#x201d; a short guy with thick glasses and a leaning tower of books cried happily. &#x201c;Those guys have been defining obnoxious with their bad-hair-scare tactics.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, sorry,&#x201d; she mumbled to the nearer one, who was trying to get to his knees. The other one was using all the words that were forbidden on sitcoms. &#x201c;Your costumes are, ah, really there. I guess I&#x2019;m just a little jumpy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Buffy looked up in time to see the gathering crowd of vultures part for their queen, Cordelia, and her entourage. Before the other girl swooped down for the attack, Buffy winced and tiredly rolled her eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jumpy?&#x201d; Cordelia parroted. &#x201c;Just a little psycho, more like. Guys, take note, a major body lingo signal from Buffy here. Don&#x2019;t invade her personal space or she&#x2019;ll go all, like, special forces on you. Or maybe you thought they were real werewolves, huh, Summers?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Never know what&#x2019;s going to pop its ugly monster Pez-head up out of hell on Halloween, Cordelia. Witness your sudden arrival,&#x201d; Buffy snapped, then spun and stalked away toward the library. She could almost hear the anger building inside Cordelia Chase.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bye-bye, Buffy the walking X-File,&#x201d; Cordelia called after her, followed by a chorus of laughter from kids without the guts to make fun of her to her face.<br> <br>If she cared about fitting in, if she allowed her feelings to be hurt by someone as deep as the kiddie pool, she might have been upset. But Buffy was so above it all. She was the Slayer. Normal teen angst didn&#x2019;t stack up to fangs at your throat.<br> <br>Sometimes, it was worse.<br> <br>Sure, she was the Slayer, but Buffy&#x2019;s face was flushed and she couldn&#x2019;t have forced a smile onto her face with a Neiman Marcus shopping spree. Well, maybe that. She did need black boots. And a few other things.<br> <br>When she pulled open the door to the library, Buffy was smiling again and thinking cashmere. Winter was coming, after all. Cordelia&#x2019;s tongue was a weapon, but her hack-and-slash approach was clumsy enough that the wounds were never deep.<br> <br>At a long research table in the library was a stack of moldy old books that could only belong to one man. But despite the presence of titles like <i>Archaic Druidry, Celtic Magick</i>, and <i>Shadow Realms</i>, among many others, their owner was nowhere in sight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Giles?&#x201d; Buffy called.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d; a mumbled response came from the library&#x2019;s second-story loft. &#x201c;Oh, yes, Buffy, up here. Is school over already, or are you cutting class again?&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked up at him and realized Giles hadn&#x2019;t even taken his eyes off the racks of books.<br> <br>&#x201c;The school is burning down, Giles,&#x201d; she said, trying to raise some reaction. Nothing. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t even hear the bell. What&#x2019;s got you by the nostrils?&#x201d;<br> <br>No response.<br> <br>&#x201c;Giles?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said, distracted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be down in a moment.&#x201d;<br> <br>Buffy slid her backpack onto the table. She dropped into a chair, leaned back, and planted her feet on the scarred oak. A quick glance around told her something she&#x2019;d already known: She and Giles were alone in the library.<br> <br>Of course they were. Even before Rupert Giles left the staff of the British Museum to become school librarian at Sunnydale High&#x2014;a career move roughly equivalent to an appointment with Dr. Kevorkian&#x2014;the library wasn&#x2019;t exactly the place to be seen by people hip enough to look. It was more like a dungeon with books, and barely enough light to read them by.<br> <br>Still was. Only now, it was <i>Mission: Impossible</i> to find the books kids actually needed for class.

When the lesbian narrator's girlfriend Delores defects to the bed and Tribeca loft of photographer Mary Sunshine, the unnamed narrator picks up a Priscilla Presley look-alike at a gay dance who leaves an address book and a gun in her lap, tempting her to take violent action. Later the ineffable Punkette, a part-time go-go dancer in Jersey with whom the narrator is infatuated, is found dead, and she becomes obsessed by the urge to find and shoot the killer, as well as with the desire to frighten Delores back to her bed by shooting Mary Sunshine. It becomes impossible for the narrator to get through yet another insane day of waiting tables at Herbie's greasy coffeeshop, where Herbie's mother expects the help to eat leftovers. The story is complicated and enriched by Coco, a Puerto Rican beautician who quotes Wallace Stevens and tells stories; by Charlotte and Beatriz, an older couple who might have been threatened by Charlotte's affair with Punkette and either of whom might have murdered her; and by Daniel, Beatriz's son, a part-time, street-level drug dealer who seems to know more than he lets on about Punkette. Somehow, our heroine gets through: she gets over Delores, and she takes care of Punkette's murderer; then she gets on with her life. Schulman, a wry and passionate writer with an excellent eye for detail and ear for dialogue, has written a thoroughly up-to-date novel that makes Bright Lights, Big City and Less Than Zero seem thin and dated. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>N or M?

For me, fear was a given I factored into the events of the day, like a pebble that never leaves your shoe. In retrospect, an adult might call that a form of courage. If so, it wasn&#x2019;t much fun.<br> <br>My tale begins on a Saturday at the close of spring term of my junior year in 1952, when my father let me use his car to join my high school buds on Galveston Beach, fifty miles south of Houston. Actually, the car was not his; it was lent to him by his company for business use, with the understanding that only he would drive it. That he would lend it to me was an act of enormous trust. My friends and I had a fine day playing touch football on the sand, and as they built a bonfire toward evening, I decided to swim out to the third sandbar south of the island, the last place your feet could still touch bottom. It was not only deep and cold, it was also hammerhead country. I had never done this by myself, and even when I once swam to the third sandbar with a group, most of us had been drunk.<br> <br>I waded through the breakers, then inhaled deeply and dove into the first swell and kept stroking through the waves, crossing the first sandbar and then the second, never resting, turning my face sideways to breathe, until I saw the last sandbar, waves undulating across its crest, gulls dipping into the froth.<br> <br>I stood erect, my back tingling with sunburn. The only sounds were the gulls and the water slapping against my loins. I could see a freighter towing a scow, then they both disappeared beyond the horizon. I dove headlong into a wave and saw the sandy bottom drop away into darkness. The water was suddenly frigid, the waves sliding over me as heavy as concrete. The hotels and palm trees and the amusement pier on the beach had become miniaturized. A triangular-shaped fin sliced through the swell and disappeared beneath a wave, a solitary string of bubbles curling behind it.<br> <br>Then I felt my heart seize, and not because of a shark. I was surrounded by jellyfish, big ones with bluish-pink air sacs and gossamer tentacles that could wrap around your neck or thighs like swarms of wet yellow jackets.<br> <br>My experience with the jellyfish seemed to characterize my life. No matter how sun-spangled the day might seem, I always felt a sense of danger. It wasn&#x2019;t imaginary, either. The guttural roar of Hollywood mufflers on a souped-up Ford coupe, a careless glance at the guys in ducktail haircuts and suede stomps and pegged pants called drapes, and in seconds you could be pounded into pulp. Ever watch a television portrayal of the fifties? What a laugh.<br> <br>A psychiatrist would probably say my fears were an externalization of my problems at home. Maybe he would be right, although I have always wondered how many psychiatrists have gone up against five or six guys who carried chains and switchblades and barber razors, and didn&#x2019;t care if they lived or died, and ate their pain like ice cream. Or maybe I saw the world through a glass darkly and the real problem was me. The point is, I was always scared. Just like swimming through the jellyfish. Contact with just one of them was like touching an electric cable. My fear was so great I was urinating inside my swim trunks, the warmth draining along my thighs. Even after I had escaped the jellyfish and rejoined my high school chums by a bonfire, sparks twisting into a turquoise sky, a bottle of cold Jax in my hand, I could not rid myself of the abiding sense of terror that rested like hot coals in the pit of my stomach.<br> <br>I never discussed my home life with my friends. My mother consulted fortune-tellers, listened in on the party line, and was always giving me enemas when I was a child. She locked doors and pulled down window shades and inveighed against alcohol and the effect it had on my father. Theatricality and depression and genuine sorrow seemed her constant companions. Sometimes I would see the cautionary look in the eyes of our neighbors when my parents were mentioned in a conversation, as though they needed to protect me from learning about my own home. In moments like these I&#x2019;d feel shame and guilt and anger and not know why. I&#x2019;d sit in my bedroom, wanting to hold something that was heavy and hard in my palm, I didn&#x2019;t know what. My uncle Cody was a business partner of Frankie Carbo of Murder, Inc. My uncle introduced me to Bugsy Siegel when he was staying at the Shamrock Hotel with Virginia Hill. Sometimes I would think about these gangsters and the confidence in their expression and the deadness in their eyes when they gazed at someone they didn&#x2019;t like, and I&#x2019;d wonder what it would be like if I could step inside their skin and possess their power.<br> <br>The day I swam through the jellyfish without being stung was the day that changed my life forever. I was about to enter a country that had no flag or boundaries, a place where you gave up your cares and your cautionary instincts and deposited your heart on a stone altar. I&#x2019;m talking about the first time you fall joyously, sick-down-in-your-soul in love, and the prospect of heartbreak never crosses your mind.<br> <br>Her name was Valerie Epstein. She was sitting in a long-bodied pink Cadillac convertible, what we used to call a boat, in a drive-in restaurant wrapped in neon, near the beach, her bare shoulders powdered with sunburn. Her hair wasn&#x2019;t just auburn; it was thick and freshly washed and had gold streaks in it, and she had tied it up on her head with a bandana, like one of the women who worked in defense plants during the war. She was eating french fries one at a time with her fingers and listening to a guy sitting behind the steering wheel like a tall drink of water. His hair was lightly oiled and sun-bleached, his skin pale and free of tattoos. He wore shades, even though the sun was molten and low in the sky, the day starting to cool. With his left hand he kept working a quarter across the tops of his fingers, like a Las Vegas gambler or a guy with secret skills. His name was Grady Harrelson. He was two years older than I and had already graduated, which meant I knew who he was but he didn&#x2019;t know who I was. Grady had wide, thin shoulders, like a basketball player, and wore a faded purple T-shirt that on him somehow looked stylish. He had been voted the most handsome boy in the school not once but twice. A guy like me had no trouble hating a guy like Grady.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why I got out of my car. I was tired, and my back felt stiff and dry and peppered with salt and sand under my shirt, and I had to drive fifty miles back to Houston and return the car to my father before dark. The evening star was already winking inside a blue band of light on the horizon. I had seen Valerie Epstein twice from a distance but never up close. Maybe the fact that I&#x2019;d swum safely through a school of jellyfish was an omen. Valerie Epstein was a junior at Reagan High School, on the north side of Houston, and known for her smile and singing voice and straight A&#x2019;s. Even the greaseballs who carried chains under their car seats and stilettos in their drapes treated her as royalty.<br> <br>Get back in the car and finish your crab burger and go home, a voice said.<br> <br>For me, low self-esteem was not a step down but a step up. I was alone, yet I didn&#x2019;t want to go home. It was Saturday, and I knew that before dark my father would walk unsteadily back from the icehouse, the neighbors looking the other way while they watered their yards. I had friends, but most of them didn&#x2019;t know the real me, nor in reality did I know them. I lived in an envelope of time and space that I wanted to mail to another planet.<br> <br>I headed for the restroom, on a path between the passenger side of the convertible and a silver-painted metal stanchion with a speaker on it that was playing &#x201c;Red Sails in the Sunset.&#x201d; Then I realized Valerie Epstein was having an argument with Grady and on the brink of crying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything wrong?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Grady turned around, his neck stretching, his eyelids fluttering. &#x201c;Say again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought maybe something was wrong and y&#x2019;all needed help.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get lost, snarf.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a snarf?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you deaf?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just want to know what a snarf is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A guy who gets off on sniffing girls&#x2019; bicycle seats. Now beat it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The music speaker went silent. My ears were popping. I could see people&#x2019;s lips moving in the other cars, but I couldn&#x2019;t hear any sound. Then I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel like it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I heard you right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a free country.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not for nosy frumps, it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Leave him alone, Grady,&#x201d; Valerie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a frump?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A guy who farts in the bathtub and bites the bubbles. Somebody put you up to this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was going to the restroom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then go.&#x201d;<br> <br>This time I didn&#x2019;t reply. Somebody, probably one of Grady&#x2019;s friends, flicked a hot cigarette at my back. Grady opened his car door so he could turn around and speak without getting a crick in his neck. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, pencil dick?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aaron Holland Broussard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m about to walk you into the restroom and unscrew your head and stuff it in the commode, Aaron Holland Broussard. Then I&#x2019;m going to piss on it before I flush. What do you think of that?&#x201d;<br> <br>The popping sound in my ears started again. The parking lot and the canvas canopy above the cars seemed to tilt sideways; the red and yellow neon on the restaurant became a blur, like licorice melting, running down the windows.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing to say?&#x201d; Grady asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;A girl told me the only reason you won &#x2018;most handsome&#x2019; is that all the girls thought you were queer-bait and felt sorry for you. Some of the jocks told me the same thing. They said you used to chug pole under the seats at the football stadium.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know where the words came from. I felt like the wiring between my thoughts and my words had been severed. Cracking wise to an older guy just didn&#x2019;t happen at my high school, particularly if the older guy lived in River Oaks and his father owned six rice mills and an independent drilling company. But something even more horrible was occurring as I stood next to Grady&#x2019;s convertible. I was looking into the eyes of Valerie Epstein as though hypnotized. They were the most beautiful and mysterious eyes I had ever seen; they were deep-set, luminous, the color of violets. They were also doing something to me I didn&#x2019;t think possible: In the middle of the drive-in, my twanger had gone on autopilot. I put my hand in my pocket and tried to knock down the tent forming in my fly.<br> <br>&#x201c;You got a boner?&#x201d; Grady said, incredulous.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my car keys. They punched a hole in my pocket.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said, his face contorting with laughter. &#x201c;Hey, everybody, dig this guy! He&#x2019;s flying the flag. Anyone got a camera? When&#x2019;s the last time you got your ashes hauled, Snarfus?&#x201d;<br> <br>My face was burning. I felt I was in one of those dreams in which you wet your pants at the front of the classroom. Then Valerie Epstein did something I would never be able to repay her for, short of opening my veins. She flung her carton of french fries, ketchup and all, into Grady&#x2019;s face. At first he was too stunned to believe what she had done; he began picking fries from his skin and shirt like bloody leeches and flicking them on the asphalt. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m letting this pass. You&#x2019;re not yourself. Settle down. You want me to apologize to this kid? Hey, buddy, I&#x2019;m sorry. Yeah, you, fuckface. Here, you want some fries? I&#x2019;ll stick a couple up your nose.&#x201d;<br> <br>She got out of the car and slammed the door. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re pathetic,&#x201d; she said, jerking a graduation ring and its chain from her neck, hurling it on the convertible seat. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call. Don&#x2019;t come by the house. Don&#x2019;t write. Don&#x2019;t send your friends to make excuses for you, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Val. We&#x2019;re a team,&#x201d; he said, wiping his face with a paper napkin. &#x201c;You want another Coke?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s over, Grady. You can&#x2019;t help what you are. You&#x2019;re selfish and dishonest and disrespectful and cruel. In my stupidity, I thought I could change you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll work this out. I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>She wiped her eyes and didn&#x2019;t answer. Her face was calm now, even though her breath was still catching, as though she had hiccups.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do this to me, Val,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I love you. Get real. Are you going to let a dork like this break us up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Goodbye, Grady.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How you going to get home?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to worry about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to leave you on the street. Now get in. You&#x2019;re starting to make me mad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What a tragedy for the planet that would be,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You know what my father said of you? &#x2018;Grady&#x2019;s not a bad kid. He&#x2019;s simply incapable of being a good one.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come back. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you have a great life,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Even though the memory of kissing you makes me want to rinse my mouth with peroxide.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then she walked away, like Helen of Troy turning her back on Attica. A gust of warm wind blew newspapers along the boulevard into the sky. The light was orange and bleeding out of the clouds in the west, the horizon darkening, the waves crashing on the beach just the other side of Seawall Boulevard, the palm trees rattling dryly in the wind. I could smell the salt and the seaweed and the tiny shellfish that had dried on the beach, like the smell of birth. I watched Valerie walk through the cars to the boulevard, her beach bag swinging from her shoulder and bouncing on her butt. Grady was standing next to me, breathing hard, his gaze locked on Valerie, just as mine was, except there was an irrevocable sense of loss in his eyes that made me think of a groundswell, the kind you see rising from the depths when a storm is about to surge inland.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry this happened to y&#x2019;all,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re in public, so I can&#x2019;t do what I&#x2019;m thinking. But you&#x2019;d better find a rat hole and crawl in it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Blaming others won&#x2019;t help your situation,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He wiped a streak of ketchup off his cheek. &#x201c;I was hoping you&#x2019;d say something like that.&#x201d;</p><h2>Harry Potter Hardcover Box Set (Books 1-5)</h2><p>The first five years of Harry Potter magic are captured in a boxed set which includes The Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, The Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire, and The Order of the Phoenix.

That is the atmosphere you will be building for yourself through the morning pages. The sense of this safety may not be immediate. In fact, undertaking morning pages may feel both exciting and scary. Will I really find the time? What if I have nothing to say? You will have "something" to say-even if that something is merely griping at committing to the pages.<br><br>It is the artist date that many of you may find more tricky. It sounds so frivolous. What good could that do?<br><br>Exactly this. Artist dates reinforce your sense of safety. They strengthen your contact with a source of benevolence in the world at large. When you write morning pages you are like a person in a life raft sending out a signal: "Here. Here I am. This is what I want." But until you take your artist date, it is as if you have your receive channel shut off. In other words, you may SOS, but when the call comes back, "Tell us again, exactly," you don't hear it. You leave yourself marooned and feeling frightened. Please practice both tools together.<br><br>We speak of practicing the morning pages and practicing the artist date. You do not need to use either tool perfectly. Be gentle but persistent in your attempts. Here are the answers to some often-asked questions:<br><br>Yes, morning pages should be done in the morning. Yes, it's better to do pages "late" than not at all. (And yes, everyone is tempted to cheat a little.)<br><br>As for the artist dates, they are easily sabotaged. A friend may ask to come along. A deadline may suddenly rear its head. Be vigilant about protecting your artist date. Plan it ahead of time, execute it, and consider it a major victory no matter how frivolous it may seem at the time.<br><br>Your sense of safety will grow, along with your sense of mastery over these basic tools.<br><br>1. There is no wrong way to do morning pages. These daily morning meanderings are not meant to be art.<br><br>2. Morning pages map our own interior. Without them our dreams may remain terra incognita.<br><br>3. The morning pages move us into artist brain. Artist brain is our inventor, our child, our very own personal absent-minded professor. Artist brain says, "Hey! That is so neat!" It puts odd things together. . . .<br><br>4. The morning pages miniaturize our Censor. The Censor is part of our leftover survival brain. Any original thought can look pretty dangerous to our Censor.<br><br>5. Morning pages will allow you to detach from your negative Censor. It may even begin to seem like a grumpy cartoon character.<br><br>6. Doing your artist date, you are receiving-opening yourself to insight, inspiration, guidance.<br><br>7. When we work at our art, we dip into the well of our experience and scoop out images. Because we do this, we need to learn how to put images back. How do we fill the well? By the artist date.<br><br>8. Unfortunately, many artists never receive critical early encouragement. As a result, they may not know they are artists at all.<br><br>9. Too intimidated to become artists themselves, very often too low in self-worth to even recognize that they have an artistic dream, many people become shadow artists instead. Artists themselves but ignorant of their true identity, shadow artists are to be found shadowing declared artists.<br><br>10. Artists love other artists. Shadow artists are gravitating to their rightful tribe but cannot yet claim their birthright.<br><br>11. In recovering from our creative blocks, it is necessary to go gently and slowly. What we are after here is the healing of old wounds-not the creation of new ones.<br><br>12. Judging your early artistic efforts is artist abuse.<br><br>13. Most of the time when we are blocked in an area of our life, it is because we feel safer that way.<br><br>Negative beliefs are exactly that: beliefs, not facts. Artists need not be drunk, crazy, broke, alone-or any of a number of our culture's negative beliefs about them.<br><br>14. It is possible, quite possible, to be both an artist and romantically fulfilled. It is quite possible to be an artist and financially successful.<br><br>15. Affirmations help achieve a sense of safety and hope: I am a channel for God's creativity, and my work comes to good.<br><br>16. My dreams come from God and God has the power to accomplish them.<br><br>17. My creativity heals myself and others.<br><br>18. There is a divine plan of goodness for my work.<br><br>19. I am willing to let God create through me.<br><br>20. It is important to remember that at first flush, going sane feels exactly like going crazy.<br><br>21. As we gain strength, so will some of the attacks of self-doubt. This is normal, and we can deal with these stronger attacks when we see them as symptoms of recovery.<br><br>Week Two<br><br>Recovering a Sense of Identity<br><br>One of the first fruits of morning pages is a clearer sense of personal identity. You are starting to look with clearer eyes at how you see yourself and how you see the world around you. You may feel a sense of wonder as your true self is slowly revealed. Skepticism may be starting to give way to curiosity. Who exactly are you? As your identity gets clearer, you will find your relationships shifting. You may be starting to know and speak your mind, which makes you less easy to take advantage of, more capable of saying no. Your more poisonous playmates will not appreciate this shift in your self-worth.<br><br>Many creative people surround themselves with "crazymakers," those who discount their realities, abuse their schedules, expect special treatment, break their agreements, and generally, create chaos, which siphons off creative energy. As you recover your identity, these crazymakers may feel threatened. "You're getting selfish," they may tell you.<br><br>In the very best sense, they are right. Your self is beginning to be more visible, less embedded in the expectations of others. This can be threatening, not only to others but to you as well. Treat yourself carefully. Remember that "treating yourself like a precious object will make you strong."<br><br>It may take strength to execute your pages this week-strength in the face of your crazymakers, strength in the face of your own possible temptation to return to the person who was blocked. "Better safe than sorry," part of you may say.<br><br>I remind you: you were both safe and sorry. That is the identity you are in the process of shedding. Now that you are no longer who you were but not yet who you are becoming, you may find yourself feeling awkward, like a hatchling. Hatchlings are awkward, but they are also becoming free.<br><br>22. Remember, the morning pages are private and are not intended for the scrutiny of well-meaning friends.<br><br>23. Creativity flourishes when we have a sense of safety and self-acceptance.<br><br>24. Not surprisingly, the most poisonous playmates for us as recovering creatives are people whose creativity is still blocked. Do not expect your blocked friends to applaud your recovery.<br><br>25. Be very careful to safeguard your newly recovering artist. A related thing creatives do to avoid being creative is to involve themselves with crazymakers. Crazymakers are those personalities that create storm centers.<br><br>26. The crazymakers in your life share certain destructive patterns that make them poisonous for any sustained creative work. Crazymakers break deals and destroy schedules. Crazymakers expect special treatment. Crazymakers discount your reality. Crazymakers pretend you're crazy.<br><br>27. Crazymakers spend your time and money. Crazymakers are expert blamers. Crazymakers create dramas-but seldom where they belong.<br><br>28. Crazymakers hate schedules-except their own.<br><br>29. As frightening and abusive as life with a crazymaker is, we find it far less threatening than the challenge of a creative life of our own.<br><br>30. Perhaps the greatest barrier for any of us as we look for an expanded life is our own deeply held skepticism.<br><br>31. The reason we think it's weird to imagine an unseen helping hand is that we still doubt that it's okay for us to be creative.<br><br>32. When our little experiment provokes the universe to open a door or two, we start shying away.<br><br>33. We've gotten brave enough to try recovery but we don't want the universe to really pay attention.<br><br>34. Think of the mind as a room. In that room we keep all our usual ideas about life.<br><br>35. The room has a door. That door is ever so slightly ajar, and outside we can see a great deal of dazzling light.<br><br>36. Nudging the door open a bit more is what makes for open-mindedness.<br><br>37. We can gently set aside our skepticism-for later use, if we need it-and when a weird idea or coincidence whizzes by, gently nudge the door a little further open.<br><br>38. Attention is an act of connection.<br><br>39. The truth is that a creative life involves great swathes of attention. Attention is a way to connect and survive.<br><br>40. The reward for attention is always healing.<br><br>41. Remember that it is far harder and more painful to be a blocked artist than it is to do the work.<br><br>42. Be alert, always, for the presence of the Great Creator leading and helping your artist.<br><br>Week Three<br><br>Recovering a Sense of Power<br><br>When Mark and I teach a twelve-week course, we often refer to week three by shorthand. "It's Anger Week," we say. One of the first ways that our creative power returns to us is as anger.<br><br>"But I'm not angry," some students snap back, sparks flying from between their teeth.<br><br>Maybe it isn't anger. Maybe it's something closer to self-respect. As the morning pages build up, clearing your vision of the present, you also get a sharper look at your past. This can make for both clarity and volatility.<br><br>As you work to put your daily life in order, bits and pieces of your past may surface, including memories of times and people to whom you gave away too much of yourself.<br><br>"I wasted so much time!" you may catch yourself thinking. And then, "Other people really wasted my time!"<br><br>When this wave of clarity happens, you may see that you have been powerful enough to have survived a great deal of negativity, but that you aren't interested in taking that negativity anymore. Often to your own surprise, you may find yourself speaking up:<br><br>"No, it's not okay you're late."<br><br>"No, I have a real issue with lending you money."<br><br>"No, I'm not sick, crazy, selfish. I'm just fed up with being your battery!"<br><br>Oops! Some of this does sound like anger, even though it is more accurately a simple reclaiming of misplaced power. Many of you may feel this power in your bodies as a sort of heightened voltage. Therefore:<br><br>This is a week to focus on concrete self-nurturing acts: food in the refrigerator, cleaning out those bathroom shelves, tossing the clothes that signal low self-worth, or better yet, passing hand-me-down castoffs into the arms of Goodwill.<br><br>Practice being specific with yourself. Admit what you'd like to change. Claim your artist date and some extra "mulling" time. Remember, experience is also a form of treasure. As you experience your present and re-experience your past, you are sorting the dross from the gold and naming yourself worthy. That self-valuing is the source of your power.<br><br>43.

The act of making art exposes a society to itself.<br><br>53. Often we are wrongly shamed as creatives. From this shaming we learn that we are wrong to create.<br><br>54. Criticism that asks a question like "How could you?" can make an artist feel like a shamed child.<br><br>55. Not all criticism is shaming. In fact, even the most severe criticism when it fairly hits the mark is apt to be greeted by an internal Aha! if it shows the artist a new and valid path for work.<br><br>56. It often takes another artist to see the embryonic work that is trying to sprout. The inexperienced or harsh critical eye, instead of nurturing the shoot of art into being, may shoot it down instead.<br><br>57. We cannot make our professional critics more healthy or more loving or more constructive than they are.

His fame has lasted -- far longer than the knowledge of his world, which is needed to understand him. He has been seen by every age in terms of its own life style. Romance has wrapped him in fantasy. Propaganda has exploited him since the days of imperial Rome. He has been condemned for sins which to men of his time were merits, and credited with nineteenth-century virtues which his own culture despised. The aim of Mary Renault&#39;s study has been to peel off from this complex and dynamic human being the accumulated layers of wishful thinking, both idealizing and ideological, and show him not in our terms but his: as he saw himself, and was seen by his friends, his enemies, the men he led and the peoples he conquered. Mary Renault&#39;s best-selling novels about Alexander, Fire from Heaven and The Persian Boy, have involved her in some years&#39; close study of his life. Crucial episodes which she has re-examined are the murder of his father Philip, in which he has been accused of complicity; the sack of Thebes; the death of his general Parmenion: and the wishes he expressed upon his deathbed. From a study of the medical evidence she has suggested important possibilities about Alexander&#39;s death, and that of his lifelong friend Hephaestion. This hard-hitting, controversial biography, firmly based on the sources, challenges the ideological interpreters of Alexander, past and present, who have sought to wrench him out of the context of his era. The text is supported by carefully chosen illustrations, many of them specially commissioned, reproducing contemporary art, documents or reconstructions of events, and modern photographs of the territories Alexander covered in his travels.</p><p>The acclaimed biography of Alexander the Great.<b>MARY RENAULT</b>&nbsp;has written over a dozen novels, has had her work adapted for radio, stage, and screeen, and has been the subject of documentaries and biographies.

She lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p>K-Gr 3&#x2014;This sweet tale of the black bear that inspired the legendary children's book character Winnie-the-Pooh will resonate with readers. In the framing story, a mother tells her son, Cole, a bedtime tale about how veterinarian Harry Colebourn, a young Canadian soldier on his way to train and fight in Europe during World War I, stumbled upon a baby black bear that he bought off a trapper at a train depot. Colebourn named the bear Winnie, short for Winnipeg, a gentle reminder of his hometown, and took the bear with him to England. Winnie quickly became the mascot of his unit. But when the time came to ship out to France for combat, Colebourn left his beloved pet in the capable hands of the London Zoo. Later, Milne and his son, Christopher Robin, visited the London Zoo and Christopher Robin took an immediate shine to Winnie, developing an unusually strong bond with the animal and even playing with her in her enclosure. The boy imagined all sorts of adventures for Winnie, which became the basis for the now-famous stories written by Milne. Washes of muted colors convey a cozy cheeriness that imbues the book with warmth and comfort, while occasional interjections from young Cole add to the fun. Blackall's characters are rosy-cheeked and expressive, while Winnie is curious and whimsical. A perfect melding of beautiful art with soulful, imaginative writing, this lovely story, penned by Colebourn's great-great granddaughter, is ideal for sharing aloud or poring over individually. VERDICT Children everywhere will enjoy this tale for years.

We&#39;ve notified them of this several times, but they have thus far refused to remove the listing from their database.</p><p>In <i>The Graveyard Book</i>, Neil Gaiman has created a charming allegory of childhood. Although the book opens with a scary scene--a family is stabbed to death by "a man named Jack&#x201d; --the story quickly moves into more child-friendly storytelling. The sole survivor of the attack--an 18-month-old baby--escapes his crib and his house, and toddles to a nearby graveyard. Quickly recognizing that the baby is orphaned, the graveyard's ghostly residents adopt him, name him Nobody ("Bod"), and allow him to live in their tomb. Taking inspiration from Kipling&#x2019;s <i>The Jungle Book</i>, Gaiman describes how the toddler navigates among the headstones, asking a lot of questions and picking up the tricks of the living and the dead. In serial-like episodes, the story follows Bod's progress as he grows from baby to teen, learning life&#x2019;s lessons amid a cadre of the long-dead, ghouls, witches, intermittent human interlopers. A pallid, nocturnal guardian named Silas ensures that Bod receives food, books, and anything else he might need from the human world. Whenever the boy strays from his usual play among the headstones, he finds new dangers, learns his limitations and strengths, and acquires the skills he needs to survive within the confines of the graveyard and in wider world beyond.

Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Warning: Mark Sundeen's collection of desert adventures is not a guidebook. In fact, you're better off not trying to follow his lead in rafting Colorado's Arkansas River, camping in Rio Grande Gorge's no-camping area, or defecating over the rim of the Grand Canyon. But those hankering to get a handle on the New West will be intrigued by these episodic tales that unfold like the varying yet connected pitches on a colorful redrock climb. The narrator is a young itinerant house painter trying to figure out what is--and what is not--important in the world. His cousin and mentor Donny Brown confuses matters by preaching that the only important thing is the Right Now. Together they take off to see the splendors of the Southwest because in the desert "things are enormous and you can get on them." But soon the realities of Donny Brown's failing marriage interrupt the trip, and the narrator continues on alone, meeting odd pilgrims and misfits as he drifts from place to place. He reasons that it's easy to live in the Right Now if you're a rock star or independently wealthy; otherwise people think you're a poseur trying on hats. <p> </p><blockquote>If you don't have enough money to buy whatever you want, it's hard to prove that you are Yourself. And if you don't get money from your parents or a trust fund then you have to get a job, and then everyone can see that you're not really Yourself but some conformist instead.</blockquote><p> Sundeen's voice, a sort of wise-kernel-of-truth-wrapped-in-a-shell-of-young-naivete, can be a bit cloying, especially amidst all the winking and nodding, but the evocation of youthful discovery is touching and even poetic at times as he meanders through a desiccated land of hobos, river guides, and spiritual seekers. Along the way the absurdities of the American West (the impoundment on the Colorado River named after John Wesley Powell, for instance) pile up like so much cow dung on a campfire. "A lot of people from big cities are moving into spiritual towns like Sedona and Telluride," the narrator observes, </p><blockquote>where they can be Themself and get in touch with the Earth. A good spiritual town should have some Indians within 100 miles and good skiing or mountain biking within ten. The stores should sell turquoise bracelets and cappuccino, and there has to be a place to hook up a modem.</blockquote> By the end of the journey through such scattered settlements you've learned a lot about the people who conquered the West and even more about their unlikely heirs. <i>--Langdon Cook</i>Mark Sundeen was born in 1970 in Harbor City, CA.

This innovative history tells us how supermarkets were used as anticommunist weapons during the Cold War, and how that has shaped our current food system.<br> &nbsp;<br> The widespread appeal of supermarkets as weapons of free enterprise contributed to a &#x201c;farms race&#x201d; between the United States and the Soviet Union, as the superpowers vied to show that their contrasting approaches to food production and distribution were best suited to an abundant future. In the aftermath of the Cold War, U.S. food power was transformed into a global system of market power, laying the groundwork for the emergence of our contemporary world, in which transnational supermarkets operate as powerful institutions in a global food economy.</p><p><b>Shane Hamilton</b> is a senior lecturer in International Business and Strategy at the University of York, and the author of <i>Trucking Country: The Road to America&#x2019;s Wal-Mart Economy</i>&#x201c;an insightful and wide-ranging examination of the domestic and international implications of American food and retail policy in the mid-late twentieth century. . . . <i>Supermarket USA </i>is a succinct discussion of U.S. food systems that will be a welcome addition to Cold War historiography and the history of international food systems.

But for all the novelty of the sitcom based on Charles Addams&#x2019;s groundbreaking <i>New Yorker </i>cartoons, Hollywood&#x2019;s Addams family paled beside the cartoonist&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Not half as evil as my original characters,&#x201d; sighed Addams.<br><br>Though the haunted-household cartoons developed a following among <i>New Yorker </i>readers long before the 1960s sitcom, and the Addams and their seedy Victorian mansion soon became recognizable types, the artist with the well-known signature &#x201c;Chas Addams&#x201d; remained an enigma. Called &#x201c;the Bela Lugosi of the cartoonists,&#x201d; Addams was the cartoonist everyone&#x2013;even Hitchcock&#x2013;wanted to meet. He was bedeviled by rumors. People claimed that he slept in a coffin, collected severed fingers sent by fans, and suffered bouts of madness that sent him to the insane asylum.<br><br>The true Addams was even more fabulous than the wildest stories and cartoons. Here was a sunny, funny urbane man, &#x201c;a normal American boy,&#x201d; as he called himself, with a dog who hated children and a taste for crossbows. While producing a unique body of work featuring lovingly drawn homicidal spouses, demonic children, genteel monsters, and an everyday world crosshatched with magic, Addams raced classic sports cars, juggled beautiful women (Joan Fontaine, Jackie Kennedy, and Greta Garbo, to name a few), and charmed everyone. But though his pursuits suggest lighthearted romantic comedy, Addams&#x2019;s life had its sinister side. Far darker than anything Addams created with a brush was his relationship with a dangerous woman who forever changed his life.<br><br>In this first biography of the great cartoonist, written with exclusive access to Addams&#x2019;s intimates and his private papers, we finally meet the man behind the famed cartoons and circling rumors. Here is his surprising childhood in New Jersey, the cartoon that offended the Nazis, the friend whose early death Addams long mourned. Here are his wives, the stories behind his most famous&#x2013;and some of his most private&#x2013;cartoons, and the Addams whom even his closest friends didn&#x2019;t know.<br><br>With wit, humor, poignancy, and insight&#x2013;enhanced by rare family photographs, classic and previously unpublished cartoons, and private drawings&#x2013;Linda H.

They said he kept a guillotine at his house and received chopped-off fingers in the mail from fans. It was once reported that he had been given a monogrammed straitjacket as a birthday gift&#x2014;a garment that might have come in handy if the other stories were true, such as the one Patricia McLaughlin told about Addams moving around the living room at a party, &#x201c;methodically and imponderably depositing&#x201d; dollops of tooth powder in various corners. &#x201c;A charm to ward off cavity-causing vampires?&#x201d; she wondered. People said that Addams had married Morticia, the pale dagger in the spidery black dress from The Addams Family, that familiar band of subversives that included Gomez, Lurch, Pugsley, Wednesday, Uncle Fester, Grandma, Thing, and Cousin Itt. <br><br>The story most often heard concerned a Charles Addams cartoon about a ghoul in a maternity room, come to claim his offspring. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother to wrap it; I&#x2019;ll eat it here,&#x201d; he tells the nurse. They said that Addams would have periodic mental breakdowns and begin drawing the gruesome maternity room cartoon. Or he&#x2019;d redraw &#x201c;The Skier,&#x201d; his classic 1940 cartoon showing single ski tracks on either side of a tree, as though the skier seen vanishing down the hill has passed right through it. As Addams would begin madly sketching the skier or the maternity ghoul (depending on which version of the story you heard), his New Yorker employer had him carted off in an ambulance to the loony bin. <br><br>Everyone from Dick Cavett to medical illustrator Shirley Baty had heard the stories. George Plimpton heard them while he was still a student at Harvard during the 1940s; Wilfrid Sheed was told about them during his school years at Oxford. <br><br>And the Addams legend caught up with New Yorker staff members and contributors all over the world. What, people wanted to know, was Charles Addams really like? Even in places where people had never heard of The New Yorker, said Calvin Trillin, &#x201c;eventually they&#x2019;d get around to asking about Addams.&#x201d; James Geraghty, Addams&#x2019;s former art editor at The New Yorker, had been asked the question wherever he went. &#x201c;In Avignon I was asked . . . the French for &#x2018;What is Charles Addams really like?&#x2019; &#x201d; He had been asked the same question in Italian in Gergamo, and in Greek on the island of Rhodes. And he truly believed that if he had ever visited Timbuktu, he&#x2019;d have been asked the question in Timbuktuese: &#x201c;What is Charles Addams really like?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Are people ever disappointed when they meet you?&#x201d; a reporter once asked Addams. <br><br>&#x201c;I suppose they are. Aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he deadpanned. <br><br>Everyone from Cary Grant to the clerk at the Registry of Motor Vehicles had wanted to meet Addams. He had long ago opened his front door to find &#x201c;a fat little man standing there.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just come to see you in your natural bailiwick,&#x201d; drawled Alfred Hitchcock. <br><br>Many years before 1981, when the latest intrepid reporter went in search of answers, the name Chas Addams, as the artist abbreviated it in thick black ink in a lower corner of his cartoons (&#x201c;Just a matter of design,&#x201d; he explained; &#x201c;it looks better than writing out &#x2018;Charles&#x2019; &#x201d;), had become synonymous with black humor. He could make even a chair &#x201c;scary, grim,&#x201d; said New Yorker artist Mischa Richter. <br><br>Though much of Addams&#x2019;s work was funny without being dark, and marked by great sweetness, it was the sinister stuff that had made him famous and earned him such sobriquets as &#x201c;the Van Gogh of the Ghouls,&#x201d; &#x201c;the Bela Lugosi of the cartoonists,&#x201d; &#x201c;the graveyard guru,&#x201d; and a purveyor of &#x201c;American Gothic.&#x201d; His work was compared to that of Shakespeare and Poe. <br><br>The Addams name was intertwined with a certain kind of offbeat character and place. One saw a particular type of woman&#x2014;model-thin, with pale skin and long black hair, wearing a black dress&#x2014;and thought: &#x201c;Morticia.&#x201d; Round, bald men brought Uncle Fester to mind. The Addams name also conjured an atmosphere, and a house&#x2014;a peeling Victorian confection that had come to represent something menacing. <br><br>&#x201c;Well, it looked a bit like a Charles Addams cartoon,&#x201d; Lady Bird Johnson said in 1964, after seeing the property in Johnson City, Texas, that would become the presidential ranch. &#x201c;And I think that if I&#x2019;d been told that I was going to buy it and start trying to make it into a home I would have turned and run,&#x201d; she added. It was no coincidence that the notorious Hitchcock movie Psycho, released in 1960, had featured an Addamsesque Victorian as the home of the psychopath Norman Bates: Hitchcock had become an Addams friend and owned two of his original cartoons. <br><br>Sometimes the Addams delinquents assumed nonhuman form. There was the famous hairball, named Cousin Itt in the television series. There was the grinning, snaggletoothed, grinchy figure who had appeared in The New Yorker in 1974 tearing down a wintry mountain slope on a snowmobile, the razorlike hair on his body flying straight back: the Abominable Snowman as winter sportsman. But often Addams&#x2019;s creepiest people were the normal-looking, nondescript types, the people one passes on the street without truly seeing them: the little clerk, the drab housewife, the &#x201c;purposeful charlady,&#x201d; as Addams called her, who in a memorable 1942 cartoon raises the leg of her bound and gagged employer and continues her mechanical sweeping. <br><br>people swore that they had actually seen the maternity room cartoon, but Addams had never drawn it. He had, however, submitted a cartoon rough (an artist&#x2019;s draft) with a similar idea: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried about Albert,&#x201d; says a wife of her husband in a maternity room. &#x201c;He eats his young.&#x201d; &#x201c;It was of course rejected,&#x201d; Addams told his friend Steven M. L. Aronson, a book editor and writer. <br><br>Still, people believed what they wanted to believe. A 1978 New Yorker Thanksgiving cover by Addams showing a stunned turkey <br><br>farmer contemplating the flock that has gathered into military formations in the yard provoked some wild reactions by readers who inter- <br><br>preted the straightforward drawing as a reference to &#x201c;Nazi concentration camps.&#x201d; <br><br>And yet Addams himself had invited the misperception&#x2014;if only in jest. Hadn&#x2019;t he once answered his fan mail on a letterhead inscribed &#x201c;The Gotham Rest Home for Mental Defectives&#x201d;? Hadn&#x2019;t he worn flaming red pajamas over his clothes to one Manhattan party, and a Knights Templar robe to another? Dressed as Abe Lincoln for an awards ceremony, which wasn&#x2019;t a costume party? Taken to pedaling a tricycle (while smoking a cigar) around another party? <br><br>He had long delighted in telling reporters about some of the gifts he had received: a gilded skull, a human thighbone, a frozen beef heart in a box for Valentine&#x2019;s Day. &#x201c;I woke up the other night and felt like screaming,&#x201d; he once told a reporter. &#x201c;I thought, &#x2018;Why not? No one will ever hear me.&#x2019; So I let out a long, thin scream, and felt much better.&#x201d; <br><br>He visited snake farms. He was known to picnic in graveyards, and he sometimes took souvenirs. Friends of the cartoonist noted that it was always at Charlie&#x2019;s instigation that they found themselves dropping in at the &#x201c;booby hatch,&#x201d; or the winter home of the Ringling Bros. circus freaks in Sarasota, Florida. &#x201c;Charlie, what about you? What did you do over the weekend?&#x201d; cartoonist Mort Gerberg asked Addams over lunch one day when the mundane conversation had turned to the subject of gypsy moths. &#x201c;Well, it was really such a nice day on Sunday, I decided to take a friend for a drive&#x2014;to Creedmore,&#x201d; said Addams, referring to the state psychiatric facility in Queens. Gerberg wasn&#x2019;t sure whether he was kidding. <br><br>Addams&#x2019;s friend Ralph Fields, a lawyer who had a home on Long Island, as Addams did, recalled the time the cartoonist offered him a ride back to the city. Addams arrived at the appointed hour in his 1926 35C Bugatti (the same model Isadora Duncan was riding in when the fringes of her neck shawl caught in the spokes of a rear wheel) and from there followed a route back to New York that took them by cemeteries &#x201c;about seventy-five percent of the time,&#x201d; said Fields. &#x201c;It was a beautiful day for looking at cemeteries.&#x201d; <br><br>But Addams&#x2019;s interest in &#x201c;the aberrations of life,&#x201d; as his friend from Quogue, Walker McKinney, put it, also led to random acts of kindness. Addams took a keen interest in McKinney&#x2019;s brother, who had been brain damaged as a boy, giving him autographed copies of his cartoon collections and spiriting him away for rides in his classic cars, which included a red 1933 Aston Martin, a gleaming 1960 Bentley, and a 1927 Amilcar&#x2014;&#x201c;the poor man&#x2019;s Bugatti,&#x201d; Addams called it. He maintained a long correspondence with a fan who had been disabled in childhood by meningitis. <br><br>Addams&#x2019;s friends treasured his endless curiosity, and his irreverent, sometimes haunting one-liners: &#x201c;Okay, let&#x2019;s get out the carving set!&#x201d; he cried the day a bird hit the big glass window at a friend&#x2019;s barn and was killed. &#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;ll stab them,&#x201d; he said when the soft-shell crabs another friend had ordered for an Addams birthday dinner turned up alive. (He and his hostess, Axie Whitney, gassed them in the oven instead.) &#x201c;What a pity,&#x201d; he would sigh at the happy ending of a near-disaster. Was it any wonder that Addams loved W. C. Fields&#x2014;a perpetrator, as George Carlin would point out, rather than a victim. <br><br>Everyone had a...</p><h2>Pipsqueaks: Thirty-five Knitting Designs for Babies and Children up to Ten Years Old</h2><p>Here&#39;s a beautiful collection of unique, easy-to-make sweaters, hats, mufflers, blankets, and other lovely knitwear designs for children, newborn to age 10.

He was given to a farmer and his wife to keep watch over their baby girl, by a wise woman who had seen danger in the child's future. And when the merry, heedless Little People who live deep under the green hills steal the child away, only Catkin can rescue her&#x2014;if he solves three cunning riddles.</p><p>Grade 1-3?Told in folkloric cadence, Barber's story is about the rescue of baby Carrie, who was switched for a changeling by the Little People. The hero of the tale is a multitalented cat called Catkin, so named because he was "...so small that he could sit in comfort on the palm of a man's hand." Because Carrie was stolen while in Catkin's care, the furry fellow risks all to venture into the enchanted land inside the hill. There, of course, he answers three riddles, the last of which frees Carrie but also binds him to that land forever. Posed with a final dilemma, the Lord of the Little People seeks guidance from the Wise Woman; her solution is to have the child and cat spend each winter in the underground realm and return to their own land each spring. The language is graceful and traditionally formal, and the story is charming, resonating of the Tam Lin and Persephone legends. The full-color illustrations, mostly on pages facing text, are dark and magical, and use light and shadow impressively to create drama.

The girl and her cat are inseparable until the day that a butterfly distracts Catkin, and the Little People bear away the child to their underworld. At the risk of binding himself to the Little People forever, Catkin undertakes the strenuous task of returning the child to her devastated parents.

All I can say is I'm glad I never had to go up against Mia Hamm."-- Pel�</blockquote><p>For the more than seven million girls--from knobby-kneed tykes to high school and college stars--who are tearing across the country chasing a soccer ball and dreams of glory, there is one name that eclipses all others, male or female: Mia Hamm. With her cheetah-like acceleration and lightning bolt shot, Hamm has broken nearly every record in her sport, while galvanizing a whole new generation of fans and players. </p><p><em>Go for the Goal</em> is not only the inspiring story of how a tiny suburban sprite became a global terror with a ball (and the world) at her feet--it's also a step-by-step or dribble-by-dribble guide for any kid with the all-American dream of making the team and becoming a champion. </p><p> Filled with personal anecdotes and fully illustrated with both action and instructional photos, <em>Go for the Goal</em> shows readers exactly how to master the silky skills and techniques that have made Hamm and her teammates the finest women's soccer team in the world.</p></p><p>Mia Hamm, star of the U.S. National Soccer Team, Olympic Gold Medalist, World Cup champion, and five-time National Player of the Year, has a simple take on her talents that also explains her success: "Many people say I'm the best women's soccer player in the world. I don't think so. And because of that, someday I just might be." That's what's so appealing about Hamm as a role model, and it's the inspirational message at the heart of her autobiography. But <i>Goal</i> is only in part about herself--"There is no me in Mia," she suggests. Sure, she tells the story of the Army brat who rose to international stardom, but her book is really a pep talk and soccer instructional aimed at the hearts of the countless young women hoping to fill her enormous cleats. Mixing anecdote and opinion--she insists Kristine Lilly is the best player in the world, period--with lots of solid coaching and practical advice, Hamm breaks the game down into its essential skill components (trapping, passing, dribbling, shooting, heading, goaltending) and then addresses both the mental and physical aspects of the game in prose that talks up--not down--to her target readers. Photos (some to teach, some clearly to wow), diagrams (x's and o's of drills and plays), and tips from her teammates (Michelle Akers says, "There <i>is</i> a difference between a finisher and shooter.... The players who score tons of goals are the ones who can not only shoot but finish with deadly accuracy") help her cover the field, and Hamm scores additional points with the same contagious spirit she demonstrates every time she puts on her uniform. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i><p>Mia Hamm, star of the U.S. National Soccer Team, Olympic Gold Medalist, World Cup champion, and five-time U.S. Soccer Player of the Year, is the world's greatest female soccer player. She serves as an important role model for children, inspiring them to strive for their dreams. In 1999 she formed the Mia Hamm Foundation benefiting bone marrow disease patients and their families, as well as providing athletic opportunities for young women.

They said it was like phantom limb, ghosts of the tattoos he&#x2019;d worn in the war, put there to tell him when to run, when to be still, when to do the bad-ass dance, which direction and what range. So they allowed him some disability for that, and he lived in the trailer down by the creek. An alcoholic uncle lived there when they were little, veteran of some other war, their father&#x2019;s older brother. She and Burton and Leon used it for a fort, the summer she was ten. Leon tried to take girls there, later on, but it smelled too bad. When Burton got his discharge, it was empty, except for the biggest wasp nest any of them had ever seen. Most valuable thing on their property, Leon said. Airstream, 1977. He showed her ones on eBay that looked like blunt rifle slugs, went for crazy money in any condition at all. The uncle had gooped this one over with white expansion foam, gone gray and dirty now, to stop it leaking and for insulation. Leon said that had saved it from pickers. She thought it looked like a big old grub, but with tunnels back through it to the windows.</p><p>Coming down the path, she saw stray crumbs of that foam, packed down hard in the dark earth. He had the trailer&#x2019;s lights turned up, and closer, through a window, she partly saw him stand, turn, and on his spine and side the marks where they took the haptics off, like the skin was dusted with something dead-fish silver. They said they could get that off too, but he didn&#x2019;t want to keep going back.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Burton,&#x201d; she called.</p><p>&#x201c;Easy Ice,&#x201d; he answered, her gamer tag, one hand bumping the door open, the other tugging a new white t-shirt down, over that chest the Corps gave him, covering the silvered patch above his navel, size and shape of a playing card.</p><p>Inside, the trailer was the color of Vaseline, LEDs buried in it, bedded in Hefty Mart amber. She&#x2019;d helped him sweep it out, before he moved in. He hadn&#x2019;t bothered to bring the shop vac down from the garage, just bombed the inside a good inch thick with this Chinese polymer, dried glassy and flexible. You could see stubs of burnt matches down inside that, or the cork-patterned paper on the squashed filter of a legally sold cigarette, older than she was. She knew where to find a rusty jeweler&#x2019;s screwdriver, and somewhere else a 2009 quarter.</p><p>Now he just got his stuff out before he hosed the inside, every week or two, like washing out Tupperware. Leon said the polymer was curatorial, how you could peel it all out before you put your American classic up on eBay. Let it take the dirt with it.</p><p>Burton took her hand, squeezed, pulling her up and in.</p><p>&#x201c;You going to Davisville?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Leon&#x2019;s picking me up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Luke 4:5&#x2019;s protesting there. Shaylene said.&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged, moving a lot of muscle but not by much.</p><p>&#x201c;That was you, Burton. Last month. On the news. That funeral, in Carolina.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t quite smile.</p><p>&#x201c;You might&#x2019;ve killed that boy.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head, just a fraction, eyes narrowed.</p><p>&#x201c;Scares me, you do that shit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You still walking point, for that lawyer in Tulsa?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t playing. Busy lawyering, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best he had. Showed him that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just a game.&#x201d; Telling herself, more than him.</p><p>&#x201c;Might as well been getting himself a Marine.&#x201d;</p><p>She thought she saw that thing the haptics did, then, that shiver, then gone.</p><p>&#x201c;Need you to sub for me,&#x201d; he said, like nothing had happened. &#x201c;Five-hour shift. Fly a quadcopter.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked past him to his display. Some Danish supermodel&#x2019;s legs, retracting into some brand of car nobody she knew would ever drive, or likely even see on the road. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re on disability,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t supposed to work.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked at her.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the job?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Outsourced? VA&#x2019;ll catch you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Game,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Beta of some game.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shooter?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing to shoot. Work a perimeter around three floors of this tower, fifty-fifth to fifty-seventh. See what turns up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What does?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Paparazzi.&#x201d; He showed her the length of his index finger. &#x201c;Little things. You get in their way. Edge &#x2019;em back. That&#x2019;s all you do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tonight. Get you set up before Leon comes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Supposed to help Shaylene, later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Give you two fives.&#x201d; He took his wallet from his jeans, edged out a pair of new bills, the little windows unscratched, holograms bright.</p><p>Folded, they went into the right front pocket of her cutoffs. &#x201c;Turn the lights down,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;hurts my eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>He did, swinging his hand through the display, but then the place looked like a seventeen-year-old boy&#x2019;s bedroom. She reached over, flicked it up a little.</p><p>She sat in his chair. It was Chinese, reconfiguring to her height and weight as he pulled himself up an old metal stool, almost no paint left on it, waving a screen into view.</p><p>MILAGROS COLDIRON SA</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Who we&#x2019;re working for.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do they pay you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hefty Pal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get caught for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Goes to an account of Leon&#x2019;s,&#x201d; he said. Leon&#x2019;s Army service had been about the same time as Burton&#x2019;s in the Marines, but Leon wasn&#x2019;t due any disability. Wasn&#x2019;t, their mother said, like he could claim to have caught the dumbfuck there. Not that Flynne had ever thought Leon was anything but sly, under it all, and lazy. &#x201c;Need my log-in and the password. Hat trick.&#x201d; How they both pronounced his tag, HaptRec, to keep it private. He took an envelope from his back pocket, unfolded and opened it. The paper looked thick, creamy.</p><p>&#x201c;That from Fab?&#x201d;</p><p>He drew out a long slip of the same paper, printed with what looked to be a full paragraph of characters and symbols. &#x201c;You scan it, or type it outside that window, we&#x2019;re out a job.&#x201d;</p><p>She picked up the envelope, from where it lay on what she guessed had been a fold-down dining table. It was one of Shaylene&#x2019;s top-shelf stationery items, kept literally on a top shelf. When letter orders came in from big companies, or lawyers, you went up there. She ran her thumb across the logo in the upper left corner. &#x201c;Medell�n?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Security firm.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You said it&#x2019;s a game.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s ten thousand dollars, in your pocket.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How long you been doing this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two weeks now. Sundays off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How much you get?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Twenty-five thousand per.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Make it twenty, then. Short notice and I&#x2019;m stiffing Shaylene.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave her another two fives.</p><br><br><p><b>2.</b></p><p><b>Death Cookie</b></p><p>Netherton woke to Rainey&#x2019;s sigil, pulsing behind his lids at the rate of a resting heartbeat. He opened his eyes. Knowing better than to move his head, he confirmed that he was in bed, alone. Both positive, under current circumstances. Slowly, he lifted his head from the pillow, until he could see that his clothes weren&#x2019;t where he assumed he would have dropped them. Cleaners, he knew, would have come from their nest beneath the bed, to drag them away, flense them of whatever invisible quanta of sebum, skin-flakes, atmospheric particulates, food residue, other.</p><p>&#x201c;Soiled,&#x201d; he pronounced, thickly, having briefly imagined such cleaners for the psyche, and let his head fall back.</p><p>Rainey&#x2019;s sigil began to strobe, demandingly.</p><p>He sat up cautiously. Standing would be the real test. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>Strobing ceased. &#x201c;Un petit probl�me,&#x201d; Rainey said.</p><p>He closed his eyes, but then there was only her sigil. He opened them.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s your fucking problem, Wilf.&#x201d;</p><p>He winced, the amount of pain this caused startling him. &#x201c;Have you always had this puritanical streak? I hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a publicist,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a celebrity. That&#x2019;s interspecies.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes, a size too large for their sockets, felt gritty. &#x201c;She must be nearing the patch,&#x201d; he said, reflexively attempting to suggest that he was alert, in control, as opposed to disastrously and quite expectedly hungover.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re almost above it now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;With your problem.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s she done?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of her stylists,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;is also, evidently, a tattooist.&#x201d;</p><p>Again, the sigil dominated his private pain-filled dark. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he said, opening his eyes. &#x201c;She did?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She did.&#x201d;</p><p>"We had an extremely specific verbal on that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fix it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Now. The world&#x2019;s watching, Wilf. As much of it as we&#x2019;ve been able to scrape together, anyway. Will Daedra West make peace with the patchers, they wonder? Should they decide to back our project, they ask? We want yes, and yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They ate the last two envoys,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Hallucinating in synch with a forest of code, convinced their visitors were shamanic spirit beasts. I spent three entire days, last month, having her briefed at the Connaught. Two anthropologists, three neoprimitivist curators. No tattoos. A brand-new, perfectly blank epidermis. Now this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Talk her out of it, Wilf.&#x201d;</p><p>He stood, experimentally. Hobbled, naked, into the bathroom. Urinated as loudly as possible. &#x201c;Out of what, exactly?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Parafoiling in&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s been the plan&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In nothing but her new tattoos.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seriously? No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seriously,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Their aesthetic, if you haven&#x2019;t noticed, is about benign skin cancers, supernumerary nipples. Conventional tattoos belong firmly among the iconics of the hegemon. It&#x2019;s like wearing your cock ring to meet the pope, and making sure he sees it. Actually, it&#x2019;s worse than that. What are they like?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Posthuman filth, according to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The tattoos!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something to do with the Gyre,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Abstract.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cultural appropriation. Lovely. Couldn&#x2019;t be worse. On her face? Neck?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, fortunately. If you can talk her into the jumpsuit we&#x2019;re printing on the moby, we may still have a project.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked at the ceiling. Imagined it opening. Himself ascending. Into he knew not what.</p><p>&#x201c;Then there&#x2019;s the matter of our Saudi backing,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;which is considerable. Visible tattoos would be a stretch, there. Nudity&#x2019;s nonnegotiable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They might take it as a signal of sexual availability,&#x201d; he said, having done so himself.</p><p>&#x201c;The Saudis?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The patchers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They might take it as her offer to be lunch,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Their last, either way. She&#x2019;s a death cookie, Wilf, for the next week or so. Anyone so much as steals a kiss goes into anaphylactic shock. Something with her thumbnails, too, but we&#x2019;re less clear about that.&#x201d;</p><p>He wrapped his waist in a thick white towel. Considered the carafe of water on the marble countertop. His stomach spasmed.</p><p>&#x201c;Lorenzo,&#x201d; she said, as an unfamiliar sigil appeared, &#x201c;Wilf Netherton has your feed, in London.&#x201d;</p><p>He almost vomited, then, at the sudden input: bright saline light above the Garbage Patch, the sense of forward motion.</p><br><p><b>3.</b></p><p><b>Pushing Bugs</b></p><br><p>She managed to get off the phone with Shaylene without mentioning Burton. Shaylene had gone out with him a few times in high school, but she&#x2019;d gotten more interested when he&#x2019;d come back from the Marines, with that chest and the stories around town about Haptic Recon 1. Flynne figured Shaylene was basically doing what the relationship shows called romanticizing pathology. Not that there was a whole lot better available locally.</p><p>She and Shaylene both worried about Burton getting in trouble over Luke 4:5, but that was about all they agreed on, when it came to him. Nobody liked Luke 4:5, but Burton had a bad thing about them. She had a feeling they were just convenient, but it still scared her. They&#x2019;d started out as a church, or in a church, not liking anyone being gay or getting abortions or using birth control. Protesting military funerals, which was a thing. Basically they were just assholes, though, and took it as the measure of God&#x2019;s satisfaction with them that everybody else thought they were assholes. For Burton, they were a way around whatever kept him in line the rest of the time.</p><p>She leaned forward now, to squint under the table for the black nylon case he kept his tomahawk in. Wouldn&#x2019;t want him going up to Davisville with that. He called it an axe, not a tomahawk, but an axe was something you chopped wood with. She reached under, hooked it out, relieved to feel the weight. Didn&#x2019;t need to open it, but she did. Case was widest at the top, allowing for the part you&#x2019;d have chopped wood with. More like the blade of a chisel, but hawk-billed. Where the back of an axe would&#x2019;ve been flat, like the face of a hammer, it was spiked, like a miniature of the blade but curved the other way. Either one thick as your little finger, but ground to edges you wouldn&#x2019;t feel as you cut yourself. Handle was graceful, a little recurved, the wood soaked in something that made it tougher, springy. The maker had a forge in Tennessee, and everyone in Haptic Recon 1 got one. It looked used. Careful of her fingers, she closed the case and put it back under the table.</p><p>She swung her phone through the display, checking Badger&#x2019;s map of the county. Shaylene&#x2019;s badge was in Forever Fab, an anxious segment of purple in its emo ring. Nobody looked to be up to much, which wasn&#x2019;t exactly a surprise. Madison and Janice were gaming, Sukhoi Flankers, vintage flight sims being Madison&#x2019;s main earner. They both had their rings beige, for bored shitless, but then they always had them that way. Made four people she knew working tonight, counting her.</p><p>She bent her phone the way she liked it for gaming, thumbed HaptRec into the log-in window, entered the long-ass password. Flicked go. Nothing happened. Then the whole display popped, like the flash of a camera in an old movie, silvered like the marks of the haptics. She blinked.</p><p>And then she was rising, out of what Burton said would be a launch bay in the roof of a van. Like she was in an elevator. No control yet. And all around her, and he hadn&#x2019;t told her this, were whispers, urgent as they were faint, like a cloud of invisible fairy police dispatchers.</p><p>And this other evening light, rainy, rose and silver, and to her left a river the color of cold lead. Dark tumble of city, towers in the distance, few lights.</p><p>Camera down giving her the white rectangle of the van, shrinking in the street below. Camera up, the building towered away forever, a cliff the size of the world.</p></p><h2>Young Puffin Read Alouds the Adventures of Milly Molly Mandy</h2><p>Milly-Molly-Mandy lives in a tiny village in the heart of the countryside.

The American edition of<i>&nbsp;Vanity Fair&nbsp;</i>was launched by publisher Cond� Nast in 1913. Under the stewardship of editor Frank Crowninshield, who assigned most of the pieces in this volume, the magazine was a literary and visual treasure of the Jazz Age and featured an incomparable slate of writers through 1936, when it was folded into&nbsp;<i>Vogue&nbsp;</i>as a casualty of the Great Depression.&nbsp;<i>Vanity Fair</i>&nbsp;was revived in 1983. Carter has been its editor since 1992.<p><br><b>David Friend,&nbsp;</b>a writer, editor, producer, curator, and formerly&nbsp;<i>Life&nbsp;</i>magazine's director of photography, is&nbsp;<i>Vanity Fair</i>'s editor of creative development.</p><p></p><p></p><p>VANITY FAIR AND THE BIRTH OF THE NEW</p><p>GRAYDON CARTER</p><p>When the dreariness, the madness, and, oh, the sheer tackiness of modern life get to you, isn&#x2019;t it tempting to imagine a different life in a different place and period? The places and periods I go to in my mind&#x2014;and I have no rational explanation for this&#x2014;are invariably set in big cities in the last century: San Francisco in the sixties, Paris in the fifties, London between the wars, Los Angeles in the thirties. And for the purposes of this introduction: the New York of the twenties. New York back in those days was the fizzy incubator of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties. It was the big room: Jimmy Walker was mayor; Wall Street and bootlegging were booming; jazz, modern art, and talkies were the rage; everyone&#x2014;from statesmen to sandhogs&#x2014;was trying to get their head around the latest theories of Freud and Einstein; and the bible for the smart set was <i>Vanity Fair</i>.</p><p>It was <i>the</i> modern magazine during that early incarnation, from 1913 to 1936. And everybody, but everybody, wrote for it, including, in no particular order, P. G. Wodehouse, Alexander Woollcott, F. Scott Fitzgerald, T. S. Eliot, e. e. cummings, No�l Coward, Gertrude Stein, A. A. Milne, Stephen Leacock, Thomas Mann, Djuna Barnes, Bertrand Russell, Aldous Huxley, Langston Hughes, Sherwood Anderson, Walter Lippmann, Carl Sandburg, Theodore Dreiser, Colette, John Maynard Keynes, Ford Madox Ford, Clarence Darrow, Janet Flanner, Paul Gallico, Dalton Trumbo, William Saroyan, Thomas Wolfe, Walter Winchell, and Douglas Fairbanks (both Sr. and Jr.).</p><p>They were drawn to <i>Vanity Fair</i> by a decent word rate and by the magazine&#x2019;s editor, Frank Crowninshield. He was known as Crownie to his intimates, who recognized him for his skills as a cultural clairvoyant and a taste maker. He helped launch the seminal Armory Show in 1913, which introduced avant-garde painting to America, and was a founding trustee of the Museum of Modern Art. He would also play a significant role in the birth of what came to be known as caf� society, cohosting small get-togethers with Cond� Nast, the publisher of <i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>Vogue.</i> Their parties brought together the era&#x2019;s brightest minds, talents, and wits, and were staged at the thirty-room penthouse apartment at 1040 Park Avenue that Crowninshield and Nast shared. (Same-sex domesticity was not uncommon back then.)</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>For twenty-two roller-coaster years, Crowninshield reveled in his singular cultural perch atop the masthead of what became the quintessential Jazz Age magazine. His <i>Vanity Fair</i> brimmed with groundbreaking photography and bold illustration and design. But just as important&#x2014;in ample evidence here&#x2014;were its sparkling essays, commentary, profiles, poetry, and fiction from many of the most forward-thinking writers of the day. Some contributors were public intellectuals (Huxley, Russell, H. L. Mencken). Others were experts in what was then experimental art and music (Clive Bell, Roger Fry, Gertrude Stein, George Jean Nathan, Virgil Thompson, Tristan Tzara, Carl Van Vechten). Still others, such as Fitzgerald, Anita Loos, John Emerson, and Donald Ogden Stewart, would go west to seek their fortune in the movie trade.</p><p>The offices of the magazine in those days&#x2014;first on fabled West Forty-fourth Street and later in the new Graybar Building, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal&#x2014;reflected its editor&#x2019;s eclectic tastes. Crowninshield, who had a soft spot for sleight of hand, kept a deck of cards ready for the amusement of staffers or for guests who would often pop in&#x2014;Harry Houdini, say, or Charlie Chaplin. Editorial lunches with his three rising staff members, Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert Sherwood, consisted of eggs Benedict, kippered herring, chocolate �clairs, and <i>caf� sp�cial.</i></p><p>According to Cond� Nast&#x2019;s biographer Caroline Seebohm, Crownie would run the office &#x201c;with the greatest informality. Actresses, models, photographers, and writers were always milling about in the reception room, under the impression that he had invited them to a personal interview. (He often had.)&#x201d; On many Saturday nights, Crowninshield could be found gambling in the basement of a brownstone on East Thirty-seventh Street, where friends like Woollcott would place wagers on tiny mechanical horses that would zip around a tabletop racetrack, the random victor determined by what they called a &#x201c;chance machine.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Crowninshield both sought and attracted excellence. The senior editors who would pass through <i>Vanity Fair</i>&#x2019;s doors were a storied lot: not only Parker, Benchley, and Sherwood, but also Edmund Wilson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Clare Boothe Brokaw, a brash, young dynamo who would eventually sleep her way through much of the masthead. (She also wrote the play <i>The Women,</i> married Henry Luce, and became a congresswoman and a U.S. ambassador to Italy.)</p><p>The magazine regularly predicted which cultural forces would leave a lasting mark. (To that end, I recommend the stories in this volume on Picasso, Chaplin, James Joyce, W. Somerset Maugham, Joan Crawford, Cole Porter, and Babe Ruth.) They took the pulse of the period&#x2014;in real time&#x2014;with an unrivaled sense of taste. The writing in <i>Vanity Fair</i> pushed boundaries with its muscular and often experimental prose. In examining the daunting shape of things to come, the magazine&#x2019;s writers wrote about men&#x2019;s rites and women&#x2019;s rights, the intrusive media and exclusive bastions of the well-to-do. They questioned our destructive fascination with the entertainment industry and our addiction to organized sports. They used satire to criticize ostentation, Prohibition, marital duplicity, and the grinding new &#x201c;publicity machine.&#x201d; Social historian Cleveland Amory would later observe that the magazine was &#x201c;as accurate a social barometer of its time as exists.&#x201d; The finest pieces in the Jazz Age <i>Vanity Fair, </i>seventy-two of which are collected here, focus more often than not on how Americans, especially New Yorkers, in confronting the Machine Age, radical art, urbanization, Communism, Fascism, globalization (epitomized by a World War), and the battle of the sexes, were coping with the growing pains of a new phenomenon: <i>modern</i> life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1910s</p><p></p><p></p><p>THE PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIL</p><p>P. G. WODEHOUSE</p><p>FROM MAY 1914</p><p>Physical culture is in the air just now. Where, a few years ago, the average man sprang from bed to bath and from bath to breakfast-table, he now postpones his onslaught on the boiled egg for a matter of fifteen minutes. These fifteen minutes he devotes to a series of bendings and stretchings which in the course of time are guaranteed to turn him into a demi-god. The advertisement pages of the magazines are congested with portraits of stern-looking, semi-nude individuals with bulging muscles and fifty-inch chests, who urge the reader to write to them for an illustrated booklet. Weedy persons, hitherto in the Chippendale class, are developing all sort of unsuspected thews, and the moderately muscular citizen (provided he has written for and obtained the small illustrated booklet) begins to have grave doubts as to whether he will be able, if he goes on at this rate, to get the sleeves of his overcoat over his biceps.</p><p>To the superficial thinker this is all very splendid. The vapid and irreflective observer looks with approval on the growing band of village blacksmiths in our midst. But you and I, reader, shake our heads. We are uneasy. We go deeper into the matter, and we are not happy in our minds. We realize that all this physical improvement must have its effect on the soul.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>A man who does anything regularly is practically certain to become a bore. Man is by nature so irregular that, if he takes a cold bath every day or keeps a diary every day or does physical exercises every day, he is sure to be too proud of himself to keep quiet about it. He cannot help gloating over the weaker vessels who turn on the hot tap, forget to enter anything after January the fifth, and shirk the matutinal development of their sinews. He will drag the subject into any conversation in which he happens to be engaged. And especially is this so as regards physical culture.</p><p>The monotony of doing these exercises every morning is so appalling that it is practically an impossibility not to boast of having gone through with them. Many a man who has been completely reticent on the topic of his business successes and his social achievements has become a mere babbler after completing a month of physical culture without missing a day. It is the same spirit which led Vikings in the old days to burst into song when they had succeeded in cleaving some tough foeman to the chine.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Again, it is alleged by scientists that it is impossible for the physical culturist to keep himself from becoming hearty, especially at breakfast, in other words a pest. Take my own case. Once upon a time I was the most delightful person you ever met. I would totter in to breakfast of a morning with dull eyes, and sink wearily into a chair. There I would remain, silent and consequently inoffensive, the model breakfaster. No lively conversation from me. No quips. No cranks. No speeches beginning &#x201c;I see by the paper that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Nothing but silence, a soggy, soothing silence. If I wanted anything, I pointed. If spoken to, I grunted. You had to look at me to be sure that I was there. Those were the days when my nickname in the home was Little Sunshine.</p><p>Then one day some officious friend, who would not leave well alone, suggested that I should start those exercises which you see advertised everywhere. I weakly consented. I wrote for the small illustrated booklet. And now I am a different man. Little by little I have become just like that offensive young man you see in the advertisements of the give-you-new-life kind of medicines&#x2014;the young man who stands by the bedside of his sleepy friend, and says, &#x201c;What! Still in bed, old man! Why, I have been out with the hounds a good two hours. Nothing tires me since I tried Peabody and Finklestein&#x2019;s Liquid Radium.&#x201d; At breakfast I am hearty and talkative. Throughout the day I breeze about with my chest expanded, a nuisance to all whom I encounter. I slap backs. My handshake is like the bite of a horse.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, this has lost me a great many friends. But far worse has been the effect on my moral fiber. Before, I was modest. Now, I despise practically everybody except professional pugilists. I meet some great philosopher, and, instead of looking with reverence at his nobby forehead, I merely feel that, if he tried to touch his toes thirty times without bending his knees, he would be in the hospital for a week. An eminent divine is to me simply a man who would have a pretty thin time if he tried to lie on his back and wave his legs fifteen times in the air without stopping.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>There is another danger. I heard, or read, somewhere of a mild and inoffensive man to whom Nature, in her blind way, had given a wonderful right-hand punch. Whenever he got into an argument, he could not help feeling that there the punch was and it would be a pity to waste it. The knowledge that he possessed that superb hay-maker was a perpetual menace to him. He went through life a haunted man. Am I to become like him? Already, after doing these exercises for a few weeks, I have a waist-line of the consistency of fairly stale bread. In time it must infallibly become like iron. There is a rudimentary muscle growing behind my right shoulder-blade. It looks like an orange and is getting larger every day. About this time next year, I shall be a sort of human bomb. I will do my very best to control myself, but suppose a momentary irritation gets the better of me and I let myself go! It does not bear thinking of.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Brooding tensely over this state of things, I have, I think, hit on a remedy. What is required is a system of spiritual exercises which shall methodically develop the soul so that it keeps pace with the muscles and the self-esteem.</p><p>Let us say that you open with that exercise where you put your feet under the chest of drawers and sit up suddenly. Well, under my new system, instead of thinking of the effect of this maneuver on the abdominal muscles, you concentrate your mind on some such formula as, &#x201c;I must remember that I have not yet subscribed to the model farm for tuberculous cows.&#x201d;</p><p>Having completed this exercise, you stand erect and swing the arms from left to right and from right to left without moving the lower half of the body. As you do this, say to yourself, &#x201c;This, I know, is where I get the steel-and-indiarubber results on my deltoids, but I must not forget that there are hundreds of men whose confining work in the sweat shops has entirely deprived them of opportunities to contract eugenic marriages.&#x201d;</p><p>This treatment, you will find, induces a humble frame of mind admirably calculated to counterbalance the sinful pride engendered by your physical exercises.</p><p>Space forbids a complete list of these spiritual culture exercises, but I am now preparing a small illustrated booklet, particulars of which will be found in the advertising pages. An accompanying portrait shows me standing with my hands behind my head and with large, vulgar muscles standing out all over me. But there is a vast difference, which you will discover when you look at my face. I am not wearing the offensively preoccupied expression of most physical-culture advertisements. You will notice a rapt, seraphic expression in the eyes and a soft and spiritual suggestion of humility about the mouth.</p><p></p><p></p><p>AUGUST STRINDBERG</p><p>GEORG BRANDES</p><p>FROM OCTOBER 1914</p><p>Strindberg was the most brilliant author of modern Sweden, and one of the most gifted I have ever known. Ibsen, in speaking of him, once said: &#x201c;Here is a greater man than I.&#x201d;</p><p>But Strindberg was a wholly abnormal type, mentally. A man so eccentric that, except for his masterly writings, I should have called him insane.</p><p>But let me begin by saying a word as to his physical appearance! His strongly modeled forehead clashed strangely with the vulgarity of his lower features. The forehead reminded one of Jupiter&#x2019;s; the mouth and chin of a Stockholm street urchin. He looked as though he sprang from irreconcilable races. The upper part of his face was that of the mental aristocrat,&#x2014;the lower belonged to &#x201c;the servant girl&#x2019;s son,&#x201d; as he called himself in his autobiography.</p><p>During a long acquaintance with him I was fortunate in being able to agree with him on fundamental principles and to find that minor differences of opinion never irritated him against me, nor caused the slightest break between us.</p><p>It was my fate to be present at many crucial moments in Strindberg&#x2019;s mental life. More than once I have seen him on the turn-rail, as it were, which changed the entire direction of his spiritual and mental locomotive. And each time I have been able to remark how deep and sincere were his changes, even if they contained a trace of the theatrical in their outward expressions.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;...</p></p><h2>An Available Man: A Novel</h2><p>In this tender and funny novel, award-winning author Hilma Wolitzer mines the unpredictable fallout of suddenly becoming single later in life, and the chaos and joys of falling in love the second time around. When Edward Schuyler, a modest and bookish sixty-two-year-old science teacher, is widowed, he finds himself ambushed by female attention. There are plenty of unattached women around, but a healthy, handsome, available man is a rare and desirable creature. Edward receives phone calls from widows seeking love, or at least lunch, while well-meaning friends try to set him up at dinner parties. Even an attractive married neighbor offers herself to him.<br><br>The problem is that Edward doesn&#x2019;t <i>feel</i> available. He&#x2019;s still mourning his beloved wife, Bee, and prefers solitude and the familiar routine of work, gardening, and bird-watching. But then his stepchildren surprise him by placing a personal ad in <i>The New York Review of Books</i> on his behalf. Soon the letters flood in, and Edward is torn between his loyalty to Bee&#x2019;s memory and his growing longing for connection. Gradually, reluctantly, he begins dating (&#x201c;dating after death,&#x201d; as one correspondent puts it), and his encounters are variously startling, comical, and sad. Just when Edward thinks he has the game figured out, a chance meeting proves that love always arrives when it&#x2019;s least expected.<br><br>With wit, warmth, and a keen understanding of the heart, <i>An Available Man</i> explores aspects of loneliness and togetherness, and the difference in the options open to men and women of a certain age. Most of all, the novel celebrates the endurance of love, and its thrilling capacity to bloom anew.</p><p><strong>Mary Gordon Reviews <i>An Available Man</i></strong> <p></p> <p><b>Mary Gordon is the author of six previous novels, two memoirs, a short-story collection, and <em>Reading Jesus</em>, a work of nonfiction.

Potentially a subject for satire or impatient, knowing ironies. But Edward Schuyler doesn't get this harsh treatment from Hilma Wolitzer. <i>An Available Man</i> is a triumph of tender observation: wry, compassionate, literate, and often very very funny.</p> <p>Edward Schuyler, a devoted high school science teacher, finds himself radically bereft when his beloved wife, Bee, dies after a painful illness. With great delicacy, Wolitzer limns the outlines of the paralyzing grief that accompanies the loss of a great love.</p> <p>But the world has a limited appetite for extended grief. Everyone urges him to move on--and by moving on they mean dating. His step-children, who are devoted to him, place an ad in the <i>New York Review of Books</i>. The results of this ad are the occasion for Wolitzer&#x2019;s most delicious observations. "'Sensual, smart, stunning, sensitive.' Oh, why do they always resort to alliteration...This one's a music lover? Well, who doesn't like music, besides the Taliban? 'Searching for that special someone to share Bach, Brecht, and breakfast.' When they&#x2019;ll probably eat bagels, bacon, and brussels sprouts."</p> <p>Some of the book's most searingly poignant moments trace the darker side of mature matchmaking (maybe alliteration's catching.) There is the grieving widow whose house is a shrine to her dead husband...and whose life is a living mausoleum. There is the seventy-something plastic surgery addict who confesses to a desperate search for an impossibly vanished youth. And then there is Edward's former love, who left him at the altar, who turns out to be...well, still crazy after all these years.</p> <p>The richness of the book can be accounted for in no small part, however, by Wolitzer's evocation of the mixture of emptiness and fullness that is Edward's life. He has his students, he's a birder, he has friends, he's a devoted stepfather...and the owner of an increasingly ailing, aging dog.</p> <p>We never fail to root for Edward, and we and he are both rewarded by a sweet and satisfying end: a well earned coda to a novel that sheds a lovely, sometimes bittersweet, but finally hopeful light on one of the important ways we live now. </p><b>Hilma Wolitzer </b>is the author of several novels, including<i> Summer Reading, The Doctor&#x2019;s Daughter, Hearts, Ending,</i> and <i>Tunnel of Love, </i>as well as a nonfiction book, <i>The Company of Writers.</i> She is a recipient of Guggenheim and NEA fellowships, an Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Barnes &amp; Noble Writer for Writers Award.&nbsp; She has taught writing at the University of Iowa, New York University, and Columbia University.</p><h2>Beatrix Farrand&#39;s Plant Book for Dumbarton Oaks</h2><p>The <i>Plant Book for Dumbarton Oaks</i> was prepared as a resource for those charged with maintenance of the gardens following their acquisition by Harvard University in 1941.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br> <br> Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br> <br> He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br> <br> Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br> <br> Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>Judgment Day!: Islam, Israel, and the Nations</h2><p>In what is possibly the most comprehensive and clear-cut examination of ancient biblical prophecy and modern-day Middle East politics regarding Islam, Israel, and the nations, <em>Judgment Day!</em> is an eye-opening page-turner for scholars, analysts, pastors, professors, politicians, and laypeople alike. Amazing historical facts and firsthand insight make this book a thrilling, sometimes troubling, read&#x2014;but one that is necessary for an accurate understanding of the prophetic times in which we live.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing parallels between the &#x201c;land for peace&#x201d; appeasement of Hitler (prior to his systematic extermination of more than 6 million Jews) and today&#x2019;s strategy of the nations united against Israel is not at all difficult&#x2014;but Dave Hunt goes much deeper than that. With painstaking clarity and detail, <em>Judgment Day!</em> reveals the ancient agenda against the Jews, and traces its twisted trail to modern-day deceptions of U.S. Presidents, foreign ambassadors, covert (and overt) military operations, businesspeople, educators, and world leaders alike.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this no-holds-barred documentary, Dave Hunt skillfully dissects the myth of Palestinian claims to &#x201c;the Promised Land&#x201d; and exposes the fraud, deceit, and treachery of an international community allied against the Jewish nation. As the author writes, &#x201c;In the final analysis, the battle over Israel is a battle for the souls and destiny of mankind. If Islam and the nations siding with her should accomplish their goal of destroying Israel, then mankind [from a biblical perspective] is eternally lost....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Why are the stakes so high? What will the outcome be? Discover the uncomfortable but irrefutable truth in Dave Hunt&#x2019;s impassioned expos�&#x2014;<em>Judgment Day!</em></p><p>Dave Hunt ministered worldwide for nearly forty years, encouraging millions of believers to diligently study God's Word and leading many to Christ. A prolific best-selling author, international lecturer, and Bible teacher, his writings have been translated into at least 50 languages. More than four million copies of Dave&#x2019;s books have been sold, which include: <em>The Cult Explosion, The God Makers, The New Spirituality, The Seduction of Christianity, Global Peace and the Rise of Antichrist, Occult Invasion, A Cup of Trembling, A Woman Rides the Beast, In Defense of the Faith, An Urgent Call to a Serious Faith, Seeking and Finding God, Judgment Day!, Yoga and the Body of Christ, What Love Is This?, Psychology and the Church,</em> and <em>Cosmos, Creator, and Human Destiny.</em> For nearly a decade, Dave also co-hosted a weekly radio program, <em>Search the Scriptures Daily</em>, broadcast on over 400 stations in the U.S. and worldwide.&#x201c;Dave Hunt&#x2019;s Judgment Day! has encyclopedic dimensions of the most crucial and vital issues of our times... &#x2018;Life and Death&#x2019; issues, which affect us both as individuals and as a Judeo-Christian community. In 1948, when the State of Israel was just re-established, 600,000 Israelis faced 80 million Arabs! Sixty-thousand ill-trained and ill-equipped Israeli &#x2018;soldiers&#x2019; of a newly organized army (six months old) crushed 600,000 (a ratio of one to ten) soldiers of four Arab armies, well trained and heavily armed, reinforced by units from seven additional Arab countries, not to mention the active help of the British. Shame and humiliation overwhelmed the whole Islamic world! To eliminate Israel, a strategy was conceived, establishing the &#x2018;unholy trinity&#x2019;: Islamic terrorism, a hostile, anti-Semitic Europe, and a corrupt United Nations. The slogan of conquest is: &#x2018;First the Saturday people, then the Sunday people.&#x2019; Europe has already been invaded by hordes of Muslims. It is all there in Dave Hunt&#x2019;s Judgment Day! Who is next? USA?! Like the biblical prophets, Dave Hunt has a vision and is not hesitant to issue a Battle Cry. Judgment Day! is a must-read and a call to action! James&#x2019; statement (2:26), &#x2018;Faith without works is dead,&#x2019; cannot be ignored! Not only will Faith be dead, but, alas, the faithful too...unless we act! Dave Hunt makes it utterly clear in Judgment Day! It is a powerful book!&#x201d; Shimon Erem, General Israeli Defense Forces, Retired (One of the most celebrated Israeli generals of all time)<br> &#x201c;Judgment Day! is a tour-de-force, both in scope, scholarship, and insight. This superbly researched work examines the most vexing global security issue facing our world today. Among his other achievements in Judgment Day!, Dave Hunt invites the reader to honestly examine and evaluate almost 1,400 years of Islamic history. &nbsp;For students of history, Judgment Day! is refreshingly honest when one considers the whitewash given this topic in mainstream academia today. &nbsp;For those who believe that Islamic militancy is an aberration of the Muslim faith, that the Jihadists have no (ruthless) designs for world domination, or that Muhammad was a man of peace, this book is required reading. &nbsp;Dave has exposed the blind side of Western liberal thinking with respect to the threat posed by the Islamists to individual freedom, democracy, and world peace. How else does one explain that in the Islamic State of today there is virtually no room for the basic freedoms that we enjoy in the West? &nbsp;Those of us living in the democracies of the West ignore this sobering, well-documented assessment at our own peril.&#x201d; &#x2014;Richard Scott, Colonel, USMC, Retired (Former Marine Chair for Security Studies, George C. Marshall Center, Garmisch, Germany)<br> &#x201c;Judgment Day! is a great revelation to the general public regarding the truth about the Islamic religion. It is a highly academic and well-documented presentation of the facts, yet written in a warm-hearted style that makes for outstanding reading. Dave develops a foundation of the beginnings of the nation of Israel and the religion of Islam, building to the end results today, as the forces of Allah threaten to take over the world. For those knowledgeable about Islam and those who are unfamiliar with the nature of it, Judgment Day! will help the reader to understand what the Muslims do, what their mindset is, and what our response should be.&#x201d; &#x2014; Florene Miller-Watson, USAF, National Chaplain, WASP (One of the only 25 women pilots who formed the original WWII Women&#x2019;s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) in 1942.)<br> &#x201c;Once in a great while, a book appears that dares to challenge the prevailing spirits of the culture. Dave Hunt&#x2019;s book, Judgment Day!, is such a book. Dave has dared to take on the divisive and potentially destructive liberal stronghold of political correctness by presenting an excellently documented work about one of the greatest threats faced by the United States, and probably the entire western world: Muslim terrorism and the eventual &#x2018;Muslimization&#x2019; of the West. Mr. Hunt and I do not agree on a number of theological points, one being the role of the nation of Israel in future history. However, I learned many years ago that if I limited my reading and listening to only those people with whom I fully agree, my life would at best be an empty vanilla existence and at worst blindsided by facts from my adversaries. Judgment Day! is a book that is a must read for every leader, church worker, and person of influence. It clearly sets forth not only the current goals of Islam but also recounts the long history of a religion that has prospered by the sword and reveals how Muslim-dominated nations deny the most basic elements of a free western civilization. Even though most Muslims are not Arabs, the Wahhabi sect domination of Islam is forcing the religion back to an eighth-century desert culture. The United States must develop an accurate working knowledge of Islam and become unified in the war against Muslim terrorism or live in a world filled with hate, destruction, threats, and eventual capitulation of our most respected human rights. We must demand that our nation&#x2019;s leaders, in every venue, project a clear understanding of the threat and set forth both domestic and international goals to defend the United States! As Dave Hunt so clearly reveals, we must not continue to permit Muslim education, apologists, or religionists to have access to use our freedoms and institutions for their destructive purposes.&#x201d; &#x2014;Clyde F. Autio, Major General, USAF, Retired<br> &#x201c;JUDGMENT DAY! is without a doubt a must read! Dave Hunt&#x2019;s superb historical research documents the seriousness of the Islamic threat not only to Israel but to every non-Muslim nation on earth. As the scholarship of this book clearly proves, militant Islam is not an aberration but a global force intent on destroying the very foundations of freedom and democracy for every man, woman, and child on the planet&#x2014;and will not stop until worldwide submission to its god, Allah, is achieved. As JUDGMENT DAY! so aptly illustrates, at the heart of Islam is an appetite for absolute rule that cannot be appeased; it leaves freedom-loving leaders no other choice but to defend now&#x2014;or be dominated for life.&#x201d; &#x2014;David Funk, MSG, USA, Retired &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on in our world? Where are we headed? What does it all mean? Dave Hunt has nailed it. This book is a wake-up call to a sleep-walking world trying to make sense of events that were foretold in the greatest book ever written, the Bible.&#x201d; &#x2014; Joseph Farah, Founder, WorldNetDaily.com<br> &#x201c;This latest book from Dave Hunt is a must read for everyone everywhere. Well written and heavily documented, Judgment Day! makes us realize that we need to wake up to the truth of what is happening in our world. The information it contains is shocking, but the reader will be thankful for the facts. The further one reads, the more compelling it becomes. Especially impressive is the courage of the author to name many of our most highly respected leaders&#x2014;exposing the truth of where they have stood regarding Islam and Israel.&#x201d; &#x2014;Earl Poysti, Founder of Russian Christian Radio (An active missionary during the Iron Curtain days, his influence continues today as President Emeritus of RCR.)<br> &#x201c;Dave Hunt&#x2019;s Judgment Day: Israel, Islam and the Nations is written from a clearly biblical perspective. His treatment of the subject offers no room for political correctness, ecumenical accommodation, or denominational loyalty. Hunt believes that many who claim to be Christians either fail to understand what the Bible says about Israel, or they willfully go against what is written. Whether they are presidents, prime ministers, popes or pivotal Protestant leaders, they risk much by going against what is plainly written in the Bible. The forces arrayed against Israel are well-organized, and quite committed to her destruction. It would be a move of wisdom for Christians to make sure which side they are on. As a Jew of Israel, I have come to appreciate the Biblical imperative for sola scriptura Christians to support Israel&#x2014;spiritually, theologically, and personally&#x2014;through the writings of Dave Hunt.&#x201d; &#x2014;David Siegel, Freelance researcher and editor of memoirs of Holocaust survivors; Israeli citizen<br> &#x201c;I have studied Dave Hunt&#x2019;s writings for years as he has stood against the tide, relentlessly exposing evil. In comparison with so many who have come and gone, or others who water down the truth, Dave runs the course and fights the good fight. Indeed, for years Dave Hunt has been a great inspiration to me and to many who came out of the darkness of Islam. In his new book, Judgment Day!, Dave calls a spade a spade and tells it as it is. He accurately, and with much historic and biblical evidence, shows beyond any doubt that the world is on a downward spiral&#x2014;and is clueless regarding the significance of the Bible, Israel, and the coming danger&#x2014;by the irrational sellout of Israel. Judgment Day! is a must-read and is crucial in exposing the things you never see in the world media regarding human destiny and the eternal consequences we face if we ignore the detailed biblical warnings so carefully detailed in this book.&#x201d; &#x2014;Walid Shoebat, Former PLO Terrorist and author of Why I Left Jihad<br> &#x201c;One of the basic tenets of warfare is &#x2018;Know your enemy.&#x2019; Dave Hunt&#x2019;s Judgment Day! introduces and explains the radical faith of Islam and the actions of its subscribers. Any military that takes on this perversion of truth in battle is doomed for defeat unless they can look beyond the current psyche that all men and their religious beliefs are good, if just understood. A &#x2018;must-read&#x2019; for all U.S. State and D.O.D. personnel as they execute this current world war. Military chaplains should read it, as they have an obligation to prepare their troops concerning the historical and religious workings of the pending enemy.&#x201d; &#x2014;Thad Hoyer, Colonel, USMC, Retired<br> &#x201c;This is the most important book on the issues of the Middle East and the Holy Land. Strangely enough, historians, politicians, journalists, and even Christians believe the lies and falsification of &#x201c;history&#x201d; conceived by the Muslims and repeated as fact through decades and centuries of propaganda. Dave Hunt goes to the roots and digs up from history...the coming judgment on Israel, Islam, and the nations. Everyone who loves the truth&#x2014;whether Christian, Muslim, or Jew&#x2014;should read it. This book can change hearts&#x2014;and even today&#x2019;s politics.&#x201d; &#x2014;Hans Kristian, President of the International Sakharov Committee, author of 33 Books &#x201c;It has been said that there may be moderate Muslims, but Islam is not moderate. Dave Hunt ably exposes this fact and reminds us that the Islam producing today&#x2019;s terrorism is the Islam of its founder, Mohammed. As such, it is as much a threat to Judaism and Christianity today as it was when it was first spread by the sword in the seventh century A.D. Dave&#x2019;s impassioned warning, however, goes beyond the political to the prophetic, alerting us of the judgment that is about to befall this planet and how to prepare an escape before that day arrives.&#x201d; &#x2014;Randall Price, Ph.D., Founder &amp; President World of the Bible Ministries, Inc.

And, in time, the survivors of that all-American city found themselves wondering if their own government had delivered them into this hell on earth.</p><p>In 1947, Texas City was experiencing boom times, bristling with chemical and oil plants, built to fuel Europe's seemingly endless appetite for the raw materials needed to rebuild its ruined cities. When an explosion ripped through its docks, the effect was cataclysmic. Thousands of people were wounded or killed, the fire department was decimated, planes were shot out of the sky, and massive ocean-bound freighters disintegrated. The blast knocked people to their knees in Galveston, ten miles away; broke windows in Houston, forty miles away; and rattled a seismograph in Denver, Colorado. Chaos reigned, the military was scrambled, the FBI launched investigations -- and ordinary citizens turned into heroes.</p><p>For months on end, the brave residents of what had once been an average American town struggled to restore their families, their homes, their lives. And they also struggled to confront another welling nightmare-the possibility that the tragedy that almost erased their city from existence might have been caused by the very government they thought would protect them.</p><p>City on Fire is a painstakingly researched saga of one of the most profound but forgotten disasters in American history. The Texas City Disaster was a searing, apocalyptic event that had an enormous ripple effect for millions of people around the world.</p><p>It changed the way Americans respond to disasters and the way people viewed the American government -- the Texas City Disaster opened the door for average Americans to confront their government and its leaders in the nation's courts of law. It was the first time that the United States of America was named as a defendant in a case that, after a series of dizzying twists and turns, would end up in the nation's highest court.</p><p>Ultimately, the story of Texas City is a story of courage, humanity, bravery, and a painful quest for justice. It is the story of ordinary Americans behaving in extraordinary ways -- and serving as role models for dignity and grace.</p></p><p><p>Bill Minutaglio is the author of the highly acclaimed biography of President George W.

Two oceangoing freighters loaded with ammonium nitrate leveled a factory town in 1947. Was it an atomic blast? Terrorism? Judgment Day? The author (First Son: George W. Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty) assembles a harrowing mosaic about a blaze during a time of racial divisions and environmental plundering amid petrochemical companies that virtually ruled Texas City, Tex. He pauses to fill in the manufacturing town's pivotal role in WWII and sketches the principals involved in the gargantuan fire. From a priest beset with apocalyptic visions to a battle-scarred mayor, these and other residents come to life. The impact of the story is marred only by slight gaffes: Minutaglio sometimes switches between past tense and present without clear reason. Nonetheless, this tale is evocatively told. His hard-edged prose brands scores of images on readers' minds: the beheaded statue of Mary; a naked father clutching onto his charred automobile; the longshoreman delivered to the morgue even though he isn't dead; and so many more. The book vividly details the carnage as well as some acts of heroism and selflessness. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Summer of Katya</h2><p>In the quiet Basque countryside in 1914, Jean-Marc Montjean, a handsome young doctor, is bewitched by the seductive, beautiful Katya.

From Italy to Scotland, from Berlin to the valleys of my native Basse Pyrenees, all of Europe shared an exceptional period of clear, delicious weather. It was the last thing they were to share for four terrible years&#x2014;save for the mud and agony, hate and death of the war that marked the boundary between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, between the Age of Grace and the Era of Efficiency.<br><br>Many who have described that summer claim to have sensed something ominous and terminal in the very excellence of the season, a last flaring up of the guttering candle, a Hellenistic burst of desperate exuberance before the death of a civilization, a final, almost hysterical, moment of laughter and joy for the young men who were to die in the trenches. I confess that my own memory of that last July, assisted to a modest degree by notes and sketches in my journal, carries no hint that I viewed the exquisite weather as an ironic jest of Fate. Perhaps I was insensitive to the omens, young as I was, filled with the juices of life, and poised eagerly on the threshold of my medical career.<br><br>These last words provoke a wry smile, as only the conventions of language allow me to describe the quarter century I have passed as a bachelor doctor in a small Basque village as a "medical career." To be sure, the bright hardworking young man that I was had every reason to hope he was on the first step of a journey to professional success, although he might have drawn some hint of a more limited future from the humiliatingly trivial tasks he was assigned by his sponsor and patron, Doctor Hippolyte Gros, who emphasized his assistant's subordinate position in dozens of ways, both subtle and bold, not the least effective of which was reminding patients that I was indeed a full-fledged doctor, despite my apparent youth and palpable lack of experience.<br><br>"Doctor Montjean will attend to writing out your prescription," he would tell a patient with a benevolent smile. "You may have every confidence in him. Oh, the ink may still be wet on his certificate, but he is well versed in all the most modern approaches to healing, both of body and mind." This last gibe was aimed at my fascination with the then new and largely mistrusted work of Doctor Freud and his followers. Doctor Gros would pat the hand of his patient (all of whom were women of a certain age, as he specialized in the "discomforts" associated with menopause) and assure her that he was honored to have an assistant who had studied in Paris. The widened eyes and tone of awe with which he said Paris were designed to suggest, in broad burlesque, that a simple provincial doctor, such as he, felt obliged to be humble before a brilliant young man from the capital who had everything to recommend him&#x2014;save perhaps experience, compassion, wisdom, understanding, and success.<br><br>Lest I create too unflattering a portrait of Doctor Gros, let me admit that it was kind of him to invite me to be his summer assistant, as I was fresh out of medical school, penniless, without any prospects for purchasing a practice, and burdened by a most uncomplimentary report of my year of internship at the mental institution of Passy. However, far from showing Doctor Gros the gratitude he had a right to expect, I courted his displeasure by confessing to him that I considered his area of specialization to be founded on old wives' tales, and his profitable summer clinic to be little more than a luxury resort for women with more leisure than common sense. In sharing these observations with him, I am sure I believed myself to be admirably open and honest for, with the callous assurance of youth, I often mistook insensitivity for frankness. It is little wonder that he occasionally retaliated against my callow self-confidence with thrusts at my inexperience and my peculiar absorption with the darker workings of the mind.<br><br>Indeed, one day in the clinic when I had been holding forth on the ethical parallels between withholding treatment from the sick and giving it to the healthy, he said to me, "You have no doubt wondered, Montjean, why I chose you to assist me this summer. Possibly you came to the conclusion that I was staggered by your academic accomplishments and impressed by the altruism revealed by your year of unpaid service at Passy. Well, there was some of that, to be sure. Then too, there was the fact that you were born in this part of France, and your dark Basque good looks are an asset to a clinic catering to women of a certain age and uncertain appetites. After all, having a Basque boy fiddle with their bits lends to the local color. But foremost among your qualities was your willingness to work cheap, which I admired because humility is an attractive and rare quality in a young doctor. However, little by little, I am coming to the view that what I mistook for humility was, in fact, an accurate evaluation of your worth."<br><br>And, the truth be told, I wasn't of all that much value to him, as there was not really enough work at the clinic to occupy two doctors. My principal worth was as insurance against his falling ill for a day or two, and as freedom for him to take the occasional day off&#x2014;days he implied were devoted to romantic preoccupations. For Doctor Gros had something of a reputation as a rake and a devil with the women who were his patients. He never boasted openly of his conquests to the worthies of Salies who were his companions over a few glasses each evening in one of the arcade cafes around the central square. Instead he relied on the silent smile, the shrug, the weak gesture of protest, to establish his reputation, not only as a romancer of potency, but as a man possessed of great discretion and a finely tuned sense of honor.<br><br>Nor did Doctor Gros's particularly advantageous position in the stream of sexual opportunity engender the jealousy one might have expected among his peers, for he was protected from their envy by a fully deserved reputation as the ugliest man in Gascony, perhaps in all of France. His was a uniquely thoroughgoing ugliness embracing both broad plan and minute detail, an ugliness the total of which was greater than the sum of the parts, an ugliness to which each feature contributed its bit, from the bulbous veiny nose, to the blotched and pitted complexion, well warted and stained, to the slack meaty mouth, to the flapping wattles, to the gnarled, irregular ears, to the undershot chin overbalanced by a beetling brow. Only his eyes, glittering and intelligent within their sunken, rheumy sockets, escaped the general aesthetic holocaust. But withal there was a peculiar attraction to his face, a fascination at the abandon with which Nature can embrace ruin, that lured one's glance again and again to his features only to have the gaze deflected by self-consciousness.<br><br>Doctor Gros was by far the wittiest and best-educated man in Salies, but the audience for his pompous, rather purple style of monologue were the dull-minded men who controlled the spa community: the owners of the hotel-restaurants, the manager of the casino, the village lawyer, the banker, all of whom felt a certain reluctant debt to the doctor, for it was his clinic that was the principal attraction for the summer tourist/patients who were the economic foundation of the town. Still&#x2014;even though Profit occupies so dominant a position in the moral order of the French bourgeois mentality that vague impulses towards fair play and decency are easily held in rein&#x2014;it is possible that the more prudish of Salies's merchants might have found Doctor Gros's cavalier treatment of the lady patients offensive, had these pampered, well-to-do women been genuinely ill. But in fact they were robust middle-class specimens whose only physical distress was having attained an age at which fashionable society allowed them to flap and flutter over "women's problems," the clinical details of which they whispered to one another with that appalled delectation later generations would reserve for sex. So it was that I alone found Doctor Gros's sexual hinting and double entendres medically unethical and socially distasteful, a view that my youthful addiction to moral simplism required me to express. Looking back, I wonder that Doctor Gros put up with my self-assured censure at all, but the peculiar fact was that he rather seemed to like me, in a gruff sort of way. He took impish delight in outraging my tidy and compact sense of ethics. Also, I was in a position, by virtue of education, to catch his puns and comic images that went over the heads of his merchant-minded cronies. But I believe the principal reason he was fond of me was nostalgic egotism: he saw in me, in both my ambitions and limitations, the young man he had been before time and fate reduced his brilliance to mere table wit, and eroded the scope of his aspirations to the dimensions of a profitable small-town clinic.<br><br>Perhaps this is why his reaction to my attitude of moral superiority was limited to giving me only the most trivial tasks to perform. And, in fact, I was not all that distressed at being relegated to the role of an elevated pharmacist, for I had just finished years of grinding work and study that had drained mind and body and was in need of a lazy summer with time on my hands, with freedom to wander through the quaint, slightly shoddy resort village or to loaf on the banks of the sparkling Gave, overarched by ancient trees and charming stone bridges. I wanted time to rest, to dream, to write.<br><br>Ah yes, write. For at that time in my life I felt capable of everything. Having attempted nothing, I had no sense of my limitations; having dared nothing, I knew no boundaries to my courage.

Maybe that's why I like Pedro's movies so much. They make me think to stop thinking or stop thinking to really think. </p><p> It is here that I prefer to dream, seated in the middle of the people I call family. To my right is my comadre, Irma "La Wirma" Granados, and next to her is her mother, Nyvia Ester Granados. </p><p> It's dinnertime on a hot July night. I should be at home, and yet I find myself lost in the timeless transparency of El Col�n watching Pedro Infante in the movie <i>La Vida No Vale Nada.</i> Pedro plays a melancholic loner named Pablo who keeps leaving any number of possible lives behind, and all sorts of women who might have loved him. He's a good-hearted vato who goes on these incredible life-changing borracheras whenever he feels overwhelmed, which is pretty much most of the time. </p><p> Ay, Dios m�o. </p><p> Pedro's lips part slightly with that naughty nene -- little boy -- grin of his as he breaks into a song. </p><p> �Ay, ay, ay! </p><p> Pedro knows me. He knows I crave his arms. His touch. His deep voice in my ear, his knowing hands on my trembling body. </p><p> H�jole. </p><p> The great flames of my dreams billow up to meet the flickering screen, as a wave of intense light consumes the sweet, painful and familiar song of my untold longing. </p><p> �Uuuuuey! The man has me going. Revved up like a swirling red, green, yellow and blue top, I can barely sit still in my seat. I sit up straight, then shiver, then melt down to hot plastic, trying to find a comfortable position. My legs are itchy, a sure sign of the troubled state of my mind, my restless body. There is no relief. I admit, years after he died tragically in a plane crash, I'm in love with Pedro. </p><p> Who isn't? </p><p> In the movie, Pedro-as-Pablo meets Cruz, the widowed owner of an antique shop in the market and he carries her groceries home for her. He offers to stay on to help and that is exactly what he does, cleaning up, fixing things, getting the shop back on its feet. And he can't help but notice how voluptuous Cruz is, despite her black widow's dress. </p><p> After exchanging glances that would have worked on any other woman, Cruz still can't admit she loves Pedro-as-Pablo. But she's thrilled to know he wants her -- his lust naked, unadorned. Only when she's behind closed doors in her room can she admit the terrible truth.<br> </p><p> What can I tell you about Pedro Infante? If you're a Mejicana or Mejicano and don't know who he is, you should be tied to a hot stove with yucca rope and beaten with sharp dry corn husks as you stand in a vat of soggy fideos. If your racial and cultural ethnicity is Other, then it's about time you learned about the most famous of Mexican singers and actors. </p><p> Pedro was born November 18, 1917, in Mazatl�n, Sinaloa, and died in 1957 in a horrible plane crash in M�rida, Yucat�n, when he was forty years old and at the height of his popularity. He was the biggest movie star in the Mexican cinema of the forties and fifties, what is called La Epoca de Oro del Cine Mejicano. Many know him as "El �dolo del Pueblo." Some people even call him the Dean Martin of M�jico, but he's more, much more than that. He was bigger than Bing Crosby or even Elvis Presley. </p><p> Pedro's real life was just as passionate as the one he played on the screen. There was his first girlfriend, Lupita Marqu�s, who bore him a little girl. And then there was his long-suffering wife, Mar�a Luisa. Then came Lupe Torrentera, the young dancer he met when she was fourteen and who bore him a daughter, Graciela Margarita, at age fifteen. Lupe was the mother of two of his other children. And, of course, there was Irma Dorantes, the young actress who starred in many of his movies and became the mother of his daughter, Irmita. The marriage to her was annulled the week before his death. </p><p> In between these women were many other women, some whose names we remember, many we don't. And one can never forget his mother, Do�a Refugia, or Do�a Cuquita, as she was known. She was really the first woman who truly loved Pedro. Pedro was the type of man who took care of the women in his life, from Do�a Refugio to Mar�a Luisa to all of his mistresses. Either he had a fantastically rich and good life or a hell of a complicated one. </p><p> If I'd had a chance and been born earlier and in a different place, I might have tried to take up with Pedro as well. But I was born in Cabritoville, U.S.A., on the Tejas/M�jico border near El Paso. The closest I'll ever come to Pedro Infante is in El Col�n on a Thursday night. In here time is suspended. In here I want to imagine the impossible, to leave, for an hour or two, my life behind. </p><p> Nyvia Ester sits behind a woman who keeps talking when Pedro-as-Pablo does something cute on-screen, or makes ojitos with his beautiful eyes -- which makes us all sticky and hot like the popcorn with butter that we're holding even though we know he's been dead for years. </p><p> All I need is a little quiet and a lot of darkness. And for the man across the aisle from me to stop smacking his dry lips and murmuring under his hot breath. </p><p> When Pedro-as-Pablo suddenly takes Cruz in his arms there is a profound and sacred silence. </p><p> Then I hear a sharp intake of breath from Nyvia Ester. Irma sighs, a barely perceptible sound of pure pleasure. I slide down in my seat, my head momentarily resting on the plastic chair back, then nervously rise with dreaded anticipation of what is to come. This is the scene where Cruz gives Pablo her father's gold watch. I can't take it. I know what's going to happen. </p><p> It breaks my heart every time Pedro-as-Pablo leaves Cruz in the middle of the night after she's given him her father's watch. Later, she wakes up to find him gone and she runs down a set of dark stairs calling out his name. But he will never come back. </p><p> Pedro-as-Pablo is the type of man who will never be faithful to one woman. It's not that he doesn't want to be, he just can't. He can't stay with Silvia, the prostitute he befriends. Eventually he earns enough money as a baker to free her from the brothel owner she's indebted to, but when she finally finds him to thank him and hopefully spend the rest of her life with him, to her surprise he doesn't want her. </p><p> More adventures, more women, a life out of control. Pedro can't stop loving and leaving women. </p><p> Now raucous with laughter, the man across from me applauds as Pedro-as-Pablo awakes to find himself in bed again, now with Silvia. </p><p> Not even Cruz could stop Pedro-as-Pablo, make him stand still, find a life of peace. He loved her, but it wasn't meant to be. There is no rest for someone as rootless as him. Only drinking will ease his pain. Silvia is someone he pities. Marta? Ay, she's a minor distraction. How can Pedro-as-Pablo love anyone when he doesn't even like himself?<br> </p><p> The temperature inside El Col�n is ninety degrees. The main floor and the balcony are packed with people of all ages, families hovering close to each other, young lovers, older couples resting like torpid flies near the water cooler.

Now, for the neophyte as well as the experienced home baker, this new encyclopedic volume on breadmaking contains more than 250 recipes for all kinds of doughs and batters using wheat, all-purpose, rye, graham and soybean flour, corn meal, oatmeal and other grains, quick breads made with baking powder or other non-yeast leavening, and many breads made with conventional organic leavening - as extensive and varied a collection as one can find today. John Braue has lovingly put together recipes collected by his family for generations. His father, a master bread baker in the Old World tradition, brought his knowledge and craft to America as an emigrant from Europe. The author writes, &#39;These priceless recipes have been handed down, family to family, baker to baker, friend to friend, tested and retested by my father and thousands of unknowns.&#39;...If you want Irish oatmeal bread, Italian bread sticks, French or Alsatian sourdough bread, Jewish honey cakes, German buttermilk rye, or if your taste runs to the exotic, such as German farmer&#39;s herb-parmesan-egg bread, it&#39;s all here. But this book is more than a collection of recipes. It recites a history of bread, the vast differences in recipe results due to climate, altitude, fours and ovens, and other fascinating bread lore....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Homilies of Wulfstan</h2><p>8vo. xiii + 384 pp, preface, life of abbreviations, 106 pp introduction-extensive detail on the manucripts, which are then categorized into four parts-1.

He called it <i>the island</i>, never the key. </p><p> Deke was a weathered fifty, or maybe seventy. He was tall and rangy and wore a battered old straw hat that looked like an inverted soup bowl. From seven in the morning until seven at night, he ran the drawbridge between Vermillion and the mainland. This was Monday to Friday. On weekends, "the kid" took over (said kid being about thirty). Some days when Em ran up to the drawbridge and saw the kid instead of Deke in the old cane chair outside the gatehouse, reading <i>Maxim</i> or <i>Popular Mechanics</i> rather than <i>The New York Times</i>, she was startled to realize that Saturday had come around again. </p><p> This afternoon, though, it was Deke. The channel between Vermillion and the mainland -- which Deke called <i>the thrut</i> (throat, she assumed) -- was deserted and dark under a dark sky. A heron stood on the drawbridge's Gulf-side rail, either meditating or looking for fish. </p><p> "Company?" Em said. "I don't have any company." </p><p> "I didn't mean it that way. Pickering's back. At 366? Brought one of his 'nieces.'" The punctuation for <i>nieces</i> was provided by a roll of Deke's eyes, of a blue so faded they were nearly colorless. </p><p> "I didn't see anyone," Em said. </p><p> "No," he agreed. "Crossed over in that big red M'cedes of his about an hour ago, while you were probably still lacin' up your tennies." He leaned forward over his newspaper; it crackled against his flat belly. She saw he had the crossword about half completed. "Different niece every summer. Always young." He paused. "Sometimes <i>two</i> nieces, one in August and one in September." </p><p> "I don't know him," Em said. "And I didn't see any red Mercedes." Nor did she know which house belonged to 366. She noticed the houses themselves, but rarely paid attention to the mailboxes. Except, of course, for 219. That was the one with the little line of carved birds on top of it. (The house behind it was, of course, Birdland.) </p><p> "Just as well," Deke said. This time instead of rolling his eyes, he twitched down the corners of his mouth, as if he had something bad tasting in there. "He brings 'em down in the M'cedes, then takes 'em back to St. Petersburg in his boat. Big white yacht. The <i>Playpen</i>. Went through this morning." The corners of his mouth did that thing again. In the far distance, thunder mumbled. "So the nieces get a tour of the house, then a nice little cruise up the coast, and we don't see Pickering again until January, when it gets cold up in Chicagoland." </p><p> Em thought she might have seen a moored white pleasure craft on her morning beach run but wasn't sure. </p><p> "Day or two from now -- maybe a week -- he'll send out a couple of fellas, and one will drive the M'cedes back to wherever he keeps it stored away. Near the private airport in Naples, I imagine." </p><p> "He must be very rich," Em said. This was the longest conversation she'd ever had with Deke, and it was interesting, but she started jogging in place just the same. Partly because she didn't want to stiffen up, mostly because her body was calling on her to run. </p><p> "Rich as Scrooge McDuck, but I got an idea Pickering actually <i>spends</i> his. Probably in ways Uncle Scrooge never imagined. Made it off some kind of computer thing, I heard." The eye roll. "Don't they all?" </p><p> "I guess," she said, still jogging in place. The thunder cleared its throat with a little more authority this time. </p><p> "I know you're anxious to be off, but I'm talking to you for a reason," Deke said. He folded up his newspaper, put it beside the old cane chair, and stuck his coffee cup on top of it as a paperweight. "I don't ordinarily talk out of school about folks on the island -- a lot of 'em's rich and I wouldn't last long if I did -- but I like you, Emmy. You keep yourself to yourself, but you ain't a bit snooty. Also, I like your father. Him and me's lifted a beer, time to time." </p><p> "Thanks," she said. She was touched. And as a thought occurred to her, she smiled. "Did my dad ask you to keep an eye on me?" </p><p> Deke shook his head. "Never did. Never would. Not R. J.'s style. He'd tell you the same as I am, though -- Jim Pickering's not a very nice man. I'd steer clear of him. If he invites you in for a drink or even just a cup of coffee with him and his new 'niece,' I'd say no. And if he were to ask you to go cruising with him, I would <i>definitely</i> say no." </p><p> "I have no interest in cruising anywhere," she said. What she was interested in was finishing her work on Vermillion Key. She felt it was almost done. "And I better get back before the rain starts." </p><p> "Don't think it's coming until five, at least," Deke said. "Although if I'm wrong, I think you'll still be okay." </p><p> She smiled again. "Me too. Contrary to popular opinion, women don't melt in the rain. I'll tell my dad you said hello." </p><p> "You do that." He bent down to get his paper, then paused, looking at her from beneath that ridiculous hat. "How're you doing, anyway?" </p><p> "Better," she said. "Better every day." She turned and began her road run back to the Little Grass Shack. She raised her hand as she went, and as she did, the heron that had been perched on the drawbridge rail flapped past her with a fish in its long bill. <br> </p><p> Three sixty-six turned out to be the Pillbox, and for the first time since she'd come to Vermillion, the gate was standing ajar. Or had it been ajar when she ran past it toward the bridge? She couldn't remember -- but of course she had taken up wearing a watch, a clunky thing with a big digital readout, so she could time herself. She had probably been looking at that when she went by. </p><p> She almost passed without slowing -- the thunder was closer now -- but she wasn't exactly wearing a thousand-dollar suede skirt from Jill Anderson, only an ensemble from the Athletic Attic: shorts and a T-shirt with the Nike swoosh on it. Besides, what had she said to Deke? <i>Women don't melt in the rain</i>. So she slowed, swerved, and had a peek. It was simple curiosity. </p><p> She thought the Mercedes parked in the courtyard was a 450 SL, because her father had one like it, although his was pretty old now and this one looked brand-new. It was candy-apple red, its body brilliant even under the darkening sky. The trunk was open. A sheaf of long blond hair hung from it. There was blood in the hair. </p><p> Had Deke said the girl with Pickering was a blond? That was her first question, and she was so shocked, so fucking <i>amazed</i>, that there was no surprise in it. It seemed like a perfectly reasonable question, and the answer was Deke hadn't said. Only that she was young. And a niece. With the eye roll. </p><p> Thunder rumbled. Almost directly overhead now. The courtyard was empty except for the car (and the blond in the trunk, there was her). The house looked deserted, too: buttoned up and more like a pillbox than ever. Even the palms swaying around it couldn't soften it. It was too big, too stark, too gray. It was an ugly house. </p><p> Em thought she heard a moan. She ran through the gate and across the yard to the open trunk without even thinking about it. She looked in. The girl in the trunk hadn't moaned. Her eyes were open, but she had been stabbed in what looked like dozens of places, and her throat was cut ear to ear. </p><p> Em stood looking in, too shocked to move, too shocked to even breathe. Then it occurred to her that this was a <i>fake</i> dead girl, a movie prop. Even as her rational mind was telling her that was bullshit, the part of her that specialized in rationalization was nodding frantically. Even making up a story to backstop the idea. Deke didn't like Pickering, and Pickering's choice of female companionship? Well guess what, Pickering didn't like Deke, either! This was nothing but an elaborate practical joke. Pickering would go back across the bridge with the trunk deliberately ajar, that fake blond hair fluttering, and -- </p><p> But there were smells rising out of the trunk now. They were the smells of shit and blood. Em reached forward and touched the cheek below one of those staring eyes. It was cold, but it was skin. Oh God, it was human skin. </p><p> There was a sound behind her. A footstep. She started to turn, and something came down on her head. There was no pain, but brilliant white seemed to leap across the world. Then the world went dark.

To maintain a belief in opposition to the orthodoxy was to set oneself in opposition not merely to church and state but to a whole culture in all of its manifestations. From the eleventh century to the fifteenth, however, dissenting movements appeared with greater frequency, attracted more followers, acquired philosophical as well as theological dimensions, and occupied more and more the time and the minds of religious and civil authorities. In the perception of dissent and in the steps taken to deal with it lies the history of medieval heresy and the force it exerted on religious, social, and political communities long after the Middle Ages.</p><p>In this volume, Edward Peters makes available the most compact and wide-ranging collection of source materials in translation on medieval orthodoxy and heterodoxy in social context.</p></p><p>Edward Peters is Henry Charles Lea Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania.

The brutal murder of two teenage girls on the last day of Nora Cunningham&#x2019;s junior year in high school throws Nora into turmoil. Her certainties&#x2014;friendships, religion, her prudence, her resolve to find a boyfriend taller than she is&#x2014;are shaken or cast off altogether. Most people in Elmgrove, Maryland, share the comforting conviction that Buddy Novak, who had every reason to want his ex-girlfriend dead, is responsible for the killings. Nora agrees at first, then begins to doubt Buddy&#x2019;s guilt, and finally comes to believe him innocent&#x2014;the lone dissenting voice in Elmgrove. Told from several different perspectives, including that of the murderer, Mister Death&#x2019;s Blue-Eyed Girls is a suspenseful page-turner with a powerful human drama at its core.</p><p>Hardcover edition:$16.99 CL/$19.95 CAN978-0-547-76062-9This is the most difficult book I've ever written, mainly because it is based loosely on my own experiences as a teenager. Writing it brought back memories as intense as the day they happened. When I sat down at the computer, I traveled straight back into the past. I remembered the words of songs I'd never really forgotten, poetry and books and movies, the clothes we wore, the things we talked about -- and thought about, my feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, my increasing religious doubts, my uneasy relationship with my mother, and so on. Since it is unlike my other books, I challenged myself &nbsp;to experiment by using the present tense and employing multiple points of view-- very liberating. When I finally finished the book, I was very nervous about its reception. Would kids read it thinking it was a typical middle school ghost story? Would some be offended by Nora's leaving the Church? Or by her curiosity about sex? Or the smoking and drinking? Would people who remembered the murders be upset by my factionalized treatment of the events set in motion that June morning in 1955?&nbsp;Well, I told myself, we write the stories we have to write. And this is the best book I've ever written.

She lives on Nantucket.one<br><br>Alison had no trouble spotting her younger daughter in the crowd milling around the ferry&#x2019;s blue luggage racks. Felicity was the one who looked like an 1890s Irish peasant. She wore a flowing skirt undoubtedly made from an Indian bedspread, a lace blouse, a brightly colored shawl, and Birkenstock sandals. And dangling beaded earrings and maybe a dozen multicolored bracelets. And a backpack made out of what looked like corn husks.<br><br>Even so, she was lovely. Her dark blond hair tumbled down her back and her sweet face was heartbreakingly beautiful.<br><br>&#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; Felicity embraced Alison tightly, swiftly, then drew back and did a little dance. &#x201c;Can you believe it? Look, Ma, no kids!&#x201d; Felicity laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m awful, aren&#x2019;t I, but you know I&#x2019;ve never been away from them for three days. I&#x2019;m not sure I can walk without holding someone&#x2019;s hand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hold my hand,&#x201d; Alison suggested and led her daughter to her SUV. &#x201c;Do you have luggage on the rack?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ve got everything in my backpack. Clean underpants, a toothbrush, and a bathing suit.&#x201d;<br><br>Alison opened the hatch so Felicity could stow her backpack, and then they buckled themselves in and headed for David&#x2019;s house. &#x201c;How was the trip?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Mom, it was divine.&#x201d;<br><br>Alison had worried when Felicity said she was taking the slow ferry, which took two and a quarter hours to cross Nantucket Sound. The fast ferries took only an hour but cost more. Alison assumed it was a matter of expense. Noah kept Felicity on a limited budget, which was why Felicity&#x2019;s clothes were all from thrift stores, which Alison knew was her daughter&#x2019;s preferred way to shop. Felicity was a great believer in resisting the powerful draw of consumerism. If Felicity&#x2019;s half-�sister, Jane, ever had children, she&#x2019;d probably dress them in Chanel, but Jane swore she was never having children.<br><br>In the passenger seat beside her, Felicity was in full flood. &#x201c;. . .&nbsp;so I bought a beer&#x2014;�a beer! In the middle of the day! And took it to the upper deck, outside, and settled in one of the seats looking out to sea. I leaned my head back and soaked in the sun. It was so heavenly, so peaceful.&#x201d; Felicity burst into laughter. &#x201c;And, Mom, a guy tried to pick me up! Seriously&#x2014;�and I think he was just out of college. I couldn&#x2019;t tell him I&#x2019;m an old married woman with two kids, I was afraid it would embarrass him.&#x201d;<br><br>Alison glanced over at her daughter. &#x201c;Well, Felicity, you are only twenty-�eight. And with your gorgeous hair, and, um, the way you dress, you look like a college student yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mom, you&#x2019;re crazy. I have bags under my eyes and I&#x2019;ve gotten all pudgy. Still, it was so sweet, talking to this guy. Okay, flirting with this guy. He wants to get together for a drink tonight, but I said I was here to visit my sick mother. I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t want you to be sick, but I needed to pretend this visit was a real crisis so I couldn&#x2019;t possibly get away.&#x201d; Felicity laughed again. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s Jane? Is she here yet? Did she come by private jet?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop it. Jane is flying but not by private jet. She said she&#x2019;ll rent a car and drive to David&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, good. I didn&#x2019;t bring my laptop or even a pad of paper, because I&#x2019;m sure Jane brought hers, so when we plan your wedding, she&#x2019;ll keep a list of what we have to do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be all wedding talk. It&#x2019;s going to be such a treat, having both of you together again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, because it was always a pleasure before,&#x201d; Felicity muttered and automatically apologized. &#x201c;Sorry, I don&#x2019;t mean to be snarky. But it&#x2019;s strange, don&#x2019;t you think, how different I am from Jane? Maybe it&#x2019;s nurture, but I blame it on nature. I mean, Alice is seven now, and actually? She&#x2019;s so much like Jane. She needs a lot of private space. I think it&#x2019;s hard on her, having to share a room with Luke&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But, Felicity,&#x201d; Alison protested, &#x201c;your house is enormous. You have four bedrooms.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, but Noah thinks the kids will bond better if they sleep in the same room. Also, he doesn&#x2019;t want them to be spoiled when so many children in the world hardly even have houses.&#x201d;<br><br>Alison wanted to ask why it was, then, that Noah had purchased such a huge house. The cathedral ceiling in the living room held a fourteen-�foot evergreen at Christmas; Noah had to climb a ladder to decorate it. But she bit her tongue. She didn&#x2019;t want to be disapproving before they even arrived home.<br><br>&#x201c;Alice is bossy,&#x201d; Felicity was saying, &#x201c;and Luke, well, Luke is a maniac. So much energy!&#x201d; She sagged, fake-�pouting. &#x201c;I miss those little guys already.&#x201d; Immediately she rallied, smiling at Alison. &#x201c;But this is going to be so much fun! The three of us together again. Oh, my gosh!&#x201d;<br><br>Alison laughed at her daughter&#x2019;s enthusiasm. She steered the Jeep between tall rose of Sharon bushes and up David&#x2019;s white shell driveway, and there, in front of the house, stood Jane, leaning against her rented dark green Mini Cooper convertible. She wore a lightweight gray silk pantsuit and Manolo Blahnik stilettos. On the ground next to her were a small Herm�s suitcase, her purse, and her briefcase. Her briefcase? For two nights and a day and a half on Nantucket?<br><br>&#x201c;Jane! You&#x2019;re here!&#x201d; Felicity jumped out of the Jeep, raced over to Jane, and clutched her in a rib-�breaking bear hug. Jane wrapped her arms around her sister and rolled her eyes at Alison over Felicity&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s real. The three of us are really here together!&#x201d; Felicity crowed. &#x201c;And look at this house! Wow, Mom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s wonderful, isn&#x2019;t it? Wait till you see the view.&#x201d; Alison held the door open. &#x201c;Come in. Look around. Go upstairs and choose any bedroom you want&#x2014;�except the master bedroom, of course. I&#x2019;ll pour some iced tea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do we need snacks?&#x201d; Felicity asked, talking more to herself than to the others. &#x201c;Probably not, we don&#x2019;t want to spoil dinner and I did have that bag of Fritos on the boat. Oh, man, it is outrageously satisfying to eat Fritos without the children fighting for them or Noah acting like I&#x2019;m eating toxic chemicals.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring out a bowl of grapes,&#x201d; Alison said.<br><br>She leaned against the refrigerator, eyes closed, just listening to her two daughters chatting away as they went up the stairs. It had been a long time since the three of them had been together like this, and she wondered if they could make it through this weekend without some spat or disagreement and hurt feelings. When Alison looked at her grown, capable daughters, it was as if she were seeing living Russian matryoshka dolls, the fa�ade holding a memory of each stage of their development, down to the smallest, youngest infant, still residing within.<br><br>Her girls had never been close, and Alison felt responsible for that. True, they did have different fathers. Alison was married to Flint when she had Jane&#x2014;�she&#x2019;d married Flint because she was pregnant with Jane.<br><br>Jane had always been a loner, a reader, a prickly little perfectionist with her straight brown hair held back with a headband. Her arguing abilities were astonishing; no wonder she became a lawyer. She was always a levelheaded, straight-�A student, never once crashing the car when she learned to drive (Felicity had dented it a few times), and&#x2014;�as far as Alison had ever known&#x2014;�never once falling into the depths of a tumultuous adolescent love affair. It wasn&#x2019;t that guys didn&#x2019;t pursue Jane. She was attractive, but aloof. Elegant. She was tall, lean, with naturally arched black velvet eyebrows over her hazel eyes. She was smart, no genius, but ambitious and hardworking enough to make all As and get accepted to Harvard and then Harvard Law.<br><br>Four years younger than Jane, Felicity was the adored daughter of Alison&#x2019;s second husband, Mark. Mark had tried not to show any preference in his treatment of the girls, and he&#x2019;d succeeded. If anything, he let Jane have her way far too often. But he couldn&#x2019;t help the way his eyes softened when he looked at Felicity, who had the blue eyes and blond hair of the LaCosta family.<br><br>Felicity, Alison had to admit, was adorable. From the moment she&#x2019;d toddled across the floor, babbling with glee, Felicity was happy and friendly and girly and sweet. As she entered her teens, she chose lace and ruffles, pale pink and baby blue, short flippy skirts, and multicolored friendship bracelets (which she and her friends made themselves, of course). In high school, she&#x2019;d had lots of friends. And boyfriends. Felicity had been the drum majorette for her high school&#x2019;s marching band. She&#x2019;d been prom queen her senior year. She&#x2019;d attended the University of Vermont, married Noah right after graduation, had two babies, and become what Jane sometimes called &#x201c;the little wifey.&#x201d;<br><br>Now Jane was a lawyer in New York, and so was her husband, Scott, although they worked for separate firms. They rented an upscale apartment on West Sixty-�Fifth and went backpacking in Costa Rica and river rafting in Utah. Their lives were crazy busy and stressful and completely adult. Alison wasn&#x2019;t sure how she felt about Scott. He was so quiet, restrained, locked up. He was probably perfect for Jane.<br><br>Alison wasn&#x2019;t sure how she felt about Felicity&#x2019;s husband, Noah, either. Noah was an idealistic man, brilliant and ambitious. Straight out of college, he&#x2019;d started a company selling organic drinks with catchy, healthy names. Now, Noah was trying to make &#x201c;green food,&#x201d; alternative protein foods made, as far as Alison could tell, basically from kale and beet juice. Alison wished him well, although she worried about the stress he carried with him and how exhausted he always seemed.<br><br>Noah and Felicity&#x2019;s two gorgeous, funny, good children were the lights of Alison&#x2019;s life. The children adored their father&#x2014;�when they saw him, which wasn&#x2019;t often, since he worked at the office late into the night and on weekends. Alison did her best to feel fond of him and to smooth Felicity&#x2019;s life in little ways&#x2014;�buying her a nice new SUV for driving around with her children, or taking them on a Disney vacation.<br><br>But she couldn&#x2019;t wave a wand and make things perfect for Felicity; and, as David reminded her, Alison had her own life to live.<br><br>And she was living a wonderful life.<br><br>She&#x2019;d never dreamed, after Mark&#x2019;s death six years ago, that she would love again. Of course her love for David was quite different from her love for Mark. Mark had been the love of her life. They&#x2019;d been married for nearly twenty-�five years, and after his sudden death, after the shock and the bitterness of grief, and the support of her friends and the days of mourning with her daughters, after the tedious legal work of life insurance and the will, after the months spent with other widows joining together to relearn the movements of normal existence, Alison had finally settled down like a swan without her mate, understanding that even with his loss, the nest that was her life was a lovely creation. She took a job as a receptionist for a dental group and became friends with the staff. She was busy, helpful, and grateful for each daily pleasure. She had her two daughters, her beloved grandchildren, her comfortable house, happy memories. Many friends. Many pleasures. She could go on.<br><br>And on she went, if not happily, at least gratefully, for almost six years. She hadn&#x2019;t been prepared last June, when she visited a friend on Nantucket, to meet David Gladstone. The love of his life, Emma, had died after a long illness four years ago, and David had never planned to marry again. Like Alison, he had a busy, if lonely, life.<br><br>When Alison and David met, at a simple summer cocktail party, it was as if the moment they stepped out onto the patio, they boarded a train that would speed them into lives they&#x2019;d never anticipated. For one thing, the first miraculous, surprising, joy-�making thing, there was the chemistry. Right from the moment their eyes met, a physical attraction reawakened them to the joys of the body. Who knew that a woman could experience adolescent sexual hunger in her fifties? Right there, in the midst of perhaps two dozen other people, men and women in light summer colors, wineglasses in hand, canap�s floating by on the caterer&#x2019;s trays, right there, right then, Boom! David introduced himself. Alison shook his hand. They couldn&#x2019;t stop smiling at each other. Alison heard herself laughing softly in a feminine way she&#x2019;d thought she&#x2019;d forgotten. She practically cooed like a dove at the man.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you like to leave this party and join me for dinner?&#x201d; David had asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Alison had said. &#x201c;Yes. Yes, I would.&#x201d;<br><br>They&#x2019;d departed without saying goodbye, like a pair of teenagers sneaking away from their parents. David took her to Topper&#x2019;s, the poshest restaurant on an island blessed with posh restaurants, and while they feasted on lobster washed down with an icy champagne, they talked. Their conversation told them much about one another, but the hours they spent together told them more.</p><h2>Machine Embroidered Quilting and Applique: Simple Steps for Revolutionary Results</h2><p><p>Turn the traditional quilting process upside-out with an embroidery machine and revolutionary new techniques!</p><p>Author Eileen Roche, editor of <i>Designs in Machine Embroidery</i> magazine, will show you how to streamline the process of quilting and applique with an embroidery machine.

Perennially inspired by her love for horses and her New Hampshire farm, where she has long tended to a &#x201c;Jewish atheistic all-organic / vegetable garden,&#x201d; Kumin writes with biological precision (&#x201c;feeding the ancient mycorrhizal paths&#x201d;), an unflinchingly realistic appreciation for nature&#x2019;s equilibrium, and keenly informed outrage over humanity&#x2019;s planetary mayhem.

And each step is to be experienced for what the <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i> shows it to be: an episode in the greatest of all adventures, the eternal journey of the soul. --T. K. V. Desikachar<br>Descended from an ancient yogic lineage, T.K.V. Desikachar is recognized as yoga's foremost teacher of teachers. <i>Health, Healing, and Beyond</i> is the long-awaited study of his application of yogic practices to achieve a union of body, mind, and spirit. Desikachar's father, T. Krishnamacharya, one of the greatest healers and sages of modern Indian history, incorporated many of his country's traditions into the adaptation and teaching of yoga for contemporary society. A student of Krishnamacharya for more than thirty years, Desikachar continues his father's efforts to preserve the essential teachings of yoga established over two thousand years ago.</p><p><b>T. K.

Cravens</b> has worked extensively with Desikachar.<br>"<i>Health, Healing, and Beyond</i> is a beautifully crafted tribute to the life and teachings of Krishnamacharya, epic in scope yet intimate in nature. Desikachar speaks with quiet wisdom and a profound sense of purpose that keeps our interest continually engaged. He introduces us to the basic texts and concepts of yoga, gives insight into a variety of yogic practices, presents a yogic theory of health and healing, and explores the nature of the student-teacher relationship. Through Desikachar's affectionate humor and sensitive writing, we learn as much from the lives of father and son as from their teachings."--Donald Moyer, Director of The Yoga Room in Berkeley, CA<br><br>"My father's teaching first and foremost was based on the truth that each student must be taught according to his or her individual capacity at any given time.

White</b> (1906&#x2014;1964) was born in Bombay, India, and educated at Queen&#x2019;s College, Cambridge. His childhood was unhappy&#x2014;&#x201c;my parents loathed each other,&#x201d; he later wrote&#x2014;and he grew up to become a solitary person with a deep fund of strange lore and a tremendous enthusiasm for fishing, hunting, and flying (which he took up to overcome his fear of heights). White taught for some years at the Stowe School until the success in 1936 of <i>England Have My Bones</i>, a book about outdoor adventure, allowed him to quit teaching and become a full-time writer. Along with <i>The Goshawk</i>, White was the author of twenty-six published works, including his famed sequence of Arthurian novels, <i>The Once and Future King</i>; the fantasy <i>Mistress Masham&#x2019;s Repose</i> (published in The New York Review of Books Children&#x2019;s Collection); a collection of essays on the eighteenth century, <i>The Age of Scandal</i>; and a translation of a medieval Latin bestiary, <i>A Book of Beasts.</i> He died at sea on his way home from an American lecture tour and is buried in Piraeus, Greece.<br><br><b>Marie Winn</b>&#x2019;s recent book, <i>Red-Tails in Love: Pale Male&#x2019;s Story</i>, featured a now-famous red-tailed hawk.

The arduous experience of training a falcon to accept a person as a perch forms the character both of the bird and its keeper. The experience has been vividly described by TH White in <i>The Goshawk</i> and no reader of that book can doubt that country sports are as unlike human games as wine is unlike water. They do not satisfy some ordinary need for exercise and diversion, any more than wine quenches thirst. They answer to a deeper yearning and intoxicate us with the scent of other worlds. They open a door into the natural life of species: not the pretend life that is imposed on the domestic pet, but the real life that was ordained by nature. Hence the ritual and hence the joy. These sports are genuine rites of passage, which guide us into the world of other animals and help us to know it from within, as a world of instinct, awe and miracles." --<i>The Observer</i><br><br>&#x201c;The book chronicles the ambivalent relationship between White, author of <i>The Once and Future King</i>, and the hawk he trained.

So it&#x2019;s not surprising that many of my clients are quite nervous when they visit me for the first time! In fact there is nothing unnatural or frightening about hypnosis. Chances are, you&#x2019;ve already had the experience of going into a &#x201c;trance-like state&#x201d; in your day-to-day life. Have you ever driven to a familiar destination and found that you have no memory of the drive? Guess what? You were in a trance!</p><p>&#x2014;From &#x201c;An Introduction to Ellen O&#x2019;Farrell,<br>Hypnotherapist&#x201d; leaflet</p><p>I had never been hypnotized before. I didn&#x2019;t really believe in it, to be honest. My plan was to lie there and pretend it was working, and try not to laugh.</p><p>&#x201c;Most people are surprised by how much they enjoy it,&#x201d; said the hypnotist. She was all softness and soap; no makeup or jewelry. Her skin had a polished, translucent look, as if she only ever bathed in mountain streams. She smelled like one of those overpriced crafty shops you find in country towns: sandalwood and lavender.</p><p>The room we were in was tiny, warm and strange. It was built on the side of the house like an enclosed balcony. The carpet was musty, with faded pink roses, but the windows were modern: floor-to-ceiling panels of glass like those in an atrium. The room was flooded with light. As I walked in, the light seemed to whoosh through my head, like a brisk breeze, and I could smell old books and the sea.</p><p>We stood together, the hypnotist and me, our faces close to the windows. When you stood that close, you couldn&#x2019;t see the sand below, just the sea, a sheet of flattened, shiny tin that stretched out to the pale blue line of the horizon. &#x201c;I feel like I&#x2019;m at the helm of a boat,&#x201d; I said to the hypnotist, who seemed excessively delighted by this comment and said that was exactly how she always felt, her eyes round and shiny, like a children&#x2019;s entertainer.</p><p>We sat down opposite each other. My chair was a soft, green leather recliner. The hypnotist&#x2019;s chair was a striped red-and-cream winged armchair. There was a low coffee table in between the chairs with a box of tissues&#x2014;some people must cry, sobbing away about their past lives as starving peasants&#x2014;a jug of ice water with two perfectly round slices of lemon floating on top, two tall water glasses, a small silver bowl of shiny wrapped chocolates, and a flat tray filled with tiny colored glass marbles.</p><p>I once had a big, old-fashioned marble that belonged to my father when he was a boy. I&#x2019;d hold it in the palm of my hand for luck during exams and job interviews. I lost it a few years ago, along with all my luck.</p><p>As I looked around me, I saw that the light reflected off the ocean and onto the walls: prisms of dazzling, dancing light. It was a bit hypnotic actually. The hypnotist had her hands folded in her lap, her feet placed squarely on the ground. Flat ballet shoes, black tights, embroidered ethnic-looking skirt and cream wraparound cardigan. Hippie but elegant. New age but classic.</p><p>I thought, What a beautiful, calm life you must lead. Sitting in this extraordinary room each day, bathed in dancing light. No e-mails filling your computer screen. No irate phone calls filling your head. No meetings or spreadsheets.</p><p>I could sense her happiness. It radiated off her, sickly, like cheap perfume; not that she would ever wear cheap perfume.</p><p>I tasted sour jealousy in my mouth and helped myself to a chocolate to make it go away.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh good, I&#x2019;ll have one too,&#x201d; said the hypnotist, unwrapping the chocolate with warm, girly camaraderie, like we were old friends. She is that sort of girl. She probably has a whole circle of giggly, supportive, lovely girlfriends, the sort that hug each other hello, and have Sex in the City DVD nights and long, shrieky telephone conversations about men.</p><p>She opened a notepad on her lap and spoke with her mouth adorably full of chocolate. She said, &#x201c;Now, before we do anything, I&#x2019;m going to ask you a few questions. Oh, dear, I shouldn&#x2019;t have chosen the caramel. Chewy.&#x201d;</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t expected so many questions.</p><p>For the most part I answered honestly. They were innocuous enough. A bit pathetic even. &#x201c;What do you do for a living?&#x201d; &#x201c;What do you do to relax?&#x201d; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your favorite food?&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, the hypnotist sat back in her armchair, smiled and said, &#x201c;And tell me, why are you here today?&#x201d;</p><p>Of course, my answer to that one wasn&#x2019;t one hundred percent truthful.</p><p>He said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something I need to tell you.&#x201d;</p><p>He had placed his knife and fork on the edge of his plate, and now he was sitting up straight, with his shoulders back, as though he was finally ready to face the music. He seemed fearful and slightly ashamed.</p><p>Ellen, who had been smiling, instantly felt a painful cramp knot her stomach. (A part of her mind registered this: the way her body responded first. The mind-body-spirit connection in action. So fascinating.)</p><p>Her happy, open smile stayed foolishly frozen on her face.</p><p>She was thirty-five years old. She knew what this meant. This nice man, this self-employed, suburban surveyor, this single dad who liked camping and cricket and country music, was about to say something that would put her off her barramundi in white wine sauce. He was about to say something that would ruin her day, and it had been such a lovely day, and the barramundi was really very good.</p><p>She put down her fork regretfully.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; she said, her tone pleasantly quizzical, and every muscle in her body tightened as if she was preparing to be punched. She would cope. It wouldn&#x2019;t be the end of the world. It was only their fourth date. She hadn&#x2019;t invested that much of herself. She barely knew the man. For heaven&#x2019;s sake, he liked country music. That should have been a red flag from the beginning. Yes, she had been indulging in some hopeful daydreams in the bath tonight, but that was a common pitfall of dating. She was already moving on, working on her recovery. She would be over it by Wednesday. Thursday at the latest. Thank the Lord she hadn&#x2019;t slept with him.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t control what was about to happen, only her response to it.</p><p>For a moment she saw her mother, eyes lifted to heaven. Ellen, tell me, my darling, do you truly believe this facile self-help nonsense you spout?</p><p>She did, in fact. With all her heart. (Her mother later apologized for her comment. &#x201c;That may have been patronizing,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, and Ellen had pretended to faint in shock.)</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, can you excuse me for a minute?&#x201d; He stood up and his napkin slid to the floor. He picked it up, his face flushed, and carefully laid it on the table next to his plate.</p><p>She looked up at him.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just...&#x201d; He gestured at the back of the restaurant.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she said soothingly.</p><p>&#x201c;Over there to your left, sir.&#x201d; A waiter discreetly pointed in the direction of the toilets.</p><p>She watched him go.</p><p>Patrick Scott.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t really like the name Patrick anyway. It was a namby-pamby sort of a name. You could imagine your hairdresser being called Patrick. Also, his male friends apparently called him &#x201c;Scottie,&#x201d; which was ... well, perfectly acceptable really in that Aussie blokey way.</p><p>If he ended it, it would definitely hurt. Just a little sting, but a sharp one. There was nothing extraordinarily wonderful about Patrick Scott. He had an ordinary pleasant face (long, thin, slightly receding hairline), an ordinary body (average height, quite broad shoulders, but naturally broad, not look-at-me-I-work-out broad), an ordinary job, an ordinary life. It was just extraordinary how comfortable she&#x2019;d felt with him, almost straightaway, within minutes of meeting up with him for the very first time in that embarrassingly empty caf�. She&#x2019;d suggested the caf� and had been horrified to find it virtually deserted, so that their nervous first-date voices seemed too loud, and three bored teenage waitresses stood about the room with nothing better to do than eavesdrop on their stilted conversation. They&#x2019;d been waiting for their cappuccinos, and he was playing with a packet of sugar, turning it around in circles and tapping it on the table, when their eyes met, and they sort of grinned at each other in mutual recognition of the awfulness of the whole situation, and all of a sudden Ellen felt all the tension in her body drift away, as if she&#x2019;d been given a powerful painkiller. She had the strangest feeling that she already knew this man; she&#x2019;d known him for years. If she believed in past lives (and she didn&#x2019;t not believe in them; in her work she&#x2019;d seen it all, her mind was wide open to all sorts of bizarre possibilities), then she would have said they must have known each other before.</p><p>That sort of instant warmth had happened to her many times before with women; oh, she was the star of female friendship&#x2014;but never with a man.</p><p>So yes, she barely knew this nice surveyor called Patrick Scott, but it would hurt if he broke up with her. Probably more than a little sting.</p><p>She thought about the hundreds, maybe thousands of stories of rejection she&#x2019;d heard from her clients over the years. &#x201c;I cooked a three-course dinner party for thirteen of his relatives, and while I&#x2019;m doing the washing up, he announces he doesn&#x2019;t love me anymore.&#x201d; &#x201c;We had a fantastic holiday in Fiji, and on the way home we&#x2019;re drinking champagne and she tells me that she&#x2019;s moving out! Champagne&#x2014;as if it&#x2019;s a celebration!&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, the naked pain that still furrowed their faces, even when they were describing something that happened years ago. Rejection by a lover or even only a potential lover was so tough on the Inner Child. Fears of abandonment, memories of past hurts, feelings of inferiority and self-loathing, all rose to the surface in an unstoppable torrent of feeling.</p><p>She was trying to observe her situation, objectively, like a client&#x2019;s case history, in the hope that she could stay detached from it. It wasn&#x2019;t working.</p><p>Of course, all this panic might be for nothing. Patrick might not be about to dump her at all. There had been no signs, and she was good at reading people. That&#x2019;s what she did for a living, after all. He had said she looked &#x201c;gorgeous&#x201d; when she opened the door for him tonight, with such a pleased expression on his face, as if he&#x2019;d just been handed a gift, and he wasn&#x2019;t the smooth, charming type who automatically gave the sort of compliments women liked to hear. There had been a lot of eye contact over dinner, some of which could have qualified as &#x201c;lingering.&#x201d; Throughout the meal she had noted that he was leaning forward toward her (although perhaps he was a bit deaf; it was surprising how many men were just a little deaf&#x2014;she knew this both from dating and from her work).</p><p>She had felt that their body language and breathing rhythms were in sync, and that wasn&#x2019;t because she&#x2019;d been patterning him, at least not deliberately, the way she would with a client.</p><p>There had been no awkward pauses or uncomfortable moments. He had been interested, in a respectful way, about hypnotherapy. He didn&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;Show me! Make me cluck like a chicken!&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t sneer, or worse, take a gently condescending tone and say he wasn&#x2019;t really into &#x201c;alternative medicine.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;So do you need any trainingfor that?&#x201d; or &#x201c;Is there any money in that?&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t seem afraid. Some men she&#x2019;d dated seemed genuinely frightened that she might hypnotize them without their knowledge. He just seemed curious.</p><p>Also, a few minutes ago, he&#x2019;d shown her photos of his son! His adorable blond, skinny little eight-year-old son, on a skateboard, playing the trombone in a school band, fishing with his dad. Surely, he wouldn&#x2019;t have shown her those photos if he&#x2019;d already decided it wasn&#x2019;t going to work.</p><p>Unless the decision had just hit him with a flash. Now that she thought about it, it had been oddly abrupt, the way he put down his knife and fork to make his announcement, his eyes looking over her shoulder, as if he&#x2019;d just seen a glimpse of a different future in the distance. She&#x2019;d been midsentence, for heaven&#x2019;s sake. (She had been telling him a story about a patient who was obsessed with Jennifer Lopez. The patient was actually obsessed with John Travolta, but she always changed the details for confidentiality reasons. And the story sounded funnier if it was Jennifer Lopez.)</p><p>He&#x2019;d looked so sad. Even if he wasn&#x2019;t about to dump her, he was definitely about to say something unacceptable or unpleasant.</p><p>Perhaps he&#x2019;d lied about being a widower. He was actually still married and living with his wife, even though they slept in separate rooms.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t a surveyor at all; he was a mobster. Now the FBI would come after her and insist she wear a wire. Her body would never be found. (She&#x2019;d watched the entire series of The Sopranos on DVD last summer.)</p><p>Or perhaps he had a terminal disease. That would be terrible, but at least not personally hurtful.</p><p>Whatever it was, she was pretty sure that sunshiny feeling she&#x2019;d been experiencing all day was about to vanish.</p><p>She took a large mouthful of her wine, and looked up to see if he was on his way back from the toilets. No. Goodness. He was taking a while. Had he just splashed water on his face and was now standing at the bathroom mirror staring into his own eyes, his hands gripping the sink, breathing heavily?</p><p>He was on the run from the law.</p><p>Her own breathing was starting to get a bit ragged.</p><p>Too much imagination for her own good. Mrs. Pascoe&#x2019;s comment on her Year Seven report card.</p><p>She looked around her. The other diners were all involved in their own conversations, cutlery softly chinking against plates, the occasional not-too-raucous burst of laughter. Nobody was looking at the woman with the empty chair across from her.</p><p>Was there time? Was it really necessary? Yes.</p><p>She sat up straight in her chair and placed her hands palm down on her thighs. She closed her eyes and breathed in through her nostrils, out through her mouth. With each breath she imagined her body being filled with a powerful gold light. The light gave her energy and strength. The light filled her feet, her legs, her stomach, her arms and, finally,whoosh, it whirled around her head, so that all she could see was a golden glow, as if she was looking directly into a sunset, and for a moment she felt as if she were floating just a few centimeters above her chair.</p><p>I will be fine. Whatever he says will not touch the essence of me. I will cope. On the count of three. One ... two ...</p><p>She opened her eyes, refreshed and reinvigorated. She looked around. Nobody was staring at her. Of course, she knew that she hadn&#x2019;t really levitated above her chair while glowing like a lightbulb, but sometimes the feelings were so astoundingly real she couldn&#x2019;t believe they hadn&#x2019;t physically manifested in some way.</p><p>Self-hypnosis was such a wonderful tool. She could always tell when a student or client actually got it. They were awestruck by what their minds could achieve.

Chosen by the author himself, the poems in Notes from the Air represent John Ashbery's best work from the past two decades, from the critically acclaimed <em>April Galleons</em> and <em>Flow Chart</em> to the 2005 National Book Award finalist <em>Where Shall I Wander</em>.</p><p>While Ashbery has long been considered a powerful force in twentieth-century culture, <em>Notes from the Air</em> demonstrates clearly how important and relevant his writing continues to be, well into the twenty-first century. Many of the books from which these poems are drawn are regularly taught in university classrooms across the country, and critics and scholars vigorously debate his newest works as well as his classics. He has already published four major books since the turn of the new millennium, and, although 2007 marks his eightieth birthday, this legendary literary figure continues to write fresh, new, and vibrant poetry that remains as stimulating, provocative, and controversial as ever.</p><p><em>Notes from the Air</em> reveals, for the first time in one volume, the remarkable evolution of Ashbery's poetry from the mid-1980s into the new century, and offers an irresistible sampling of some of the finest work by this "national treasure."</p></p><p><p>John Ashbery was born in Rochester, New York, in 1927. He wrote more than twenty books of poetry, including <em>Quick Question; Planisphere; Notes from the Air; A Worldly Country; Where Shall I Wander; </em>and <em>Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror, </em>which received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the National Book Award. The winner of many prizes and awards, both nationally and internationally, he received the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from the National Book Foundation in 2011 and a National Humanities Medal, presented by President Obama at the White House, in 2012. Ashbery died in September 2017 at the age of ninety.</p>Starred Review. Ashbery's original, seminal <i>Selected Poems</i> crowned the first half of a career that has largely defined American poetry since the middle of the 20th century. One could think of that first <i>Selected</i>, published in 1985, as the summation of Ashbery's philosophical period, in which the poet self-consciously interrogated the grip&#x2014;or lack of one&#x2014;language exerts on the world at large, most notably in poems like Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror. This new volume&#x2014;beginning with poems from <i>April Galleons </i>(1987) and ending with <i>Where Shall I Wander</i> (2005)&#x2014;presents the first panoramic view of Ashbery's second phase, in which he explores, celebrates, sends up and revels in the American vernacular. Encompassing the surreal (You mop your forehead with a rose, recommending its thorns), the tender (Everything was spotless in the little house of our desire), the self-deprecating (There was I: a stinking adult) and the quietly, utterly haunting (Those who came closest did not come close), Ashbery seems to hit every possible note in his scattershot manner. Of particular interest are extended selections from the book-length works <i>Flow Chart</i> (1991) and <i>Girls on the Run</i> (1999). This is an essential book. Along with the original <i>Selected</i> (Penguin), we can now see the full impact of the most representative poet of the last 50 years. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He glanced at the balcony two floors below and then looked out across the City of Light. Sunrise was a few hours off and the flow of late-night revelers had faded to a trickle. It was that rare moment of relative inactivity that even a city as vibrant as Paris fell under once each day. Every city had its own unique feel, and Rapp had learned to pay attention to the ebb and flow of their natural rhythms. They had their similarities just like people. For all of the hang-ups about individuality, few understood that for the most part, people&#x2019;s actions were habitual. They slept, woke, ate, worked, ate some more, worked some more, ate again, watched TV, and then went to sleep again. It was the basic drumbeat of humanity the world over. The way people lived their lives and met their basic needs.<br> <br>All men also had their own unique attributes, and these often manifested themselves in habits&#x2014;habits that Rapp had learned to exploit. As a rule, the best time to strike was this witching hour, between dusk and dawn, when the overwhelming majority of the human race was asleep, or trying to sleep. The physiological reasons were obvious. If it took world-class athletes hours to warm up before a major event, how would a man defend himself when yanked from deep sleep? However, Rapp could not always choose the appointed hour, and occasionally a target&#x2019;s habits created an opening that was so painfully obvious, he simply couldn&#x2019;t ignore the opportunity.<br> <br>Three weeks earlier Rapp had been in Athens. His target walked the same bustling sidewalk every morning from his apartment to his office. Rapp had considered shooting him on the sidewalk, as there was plenty of cover and distraction. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been difficult, but witnesses were always a concern, and a police officer could always stumble by at the wrong moment. As he studied his target, he noticed another habit. After arriving at work, the man had one more cup of coffee and then went down the hall with his newspaper and took a prolonged visit to the men&#x2019;s room.<br> <br>Other than catching people asleep, the next best thing was catching them with their pants down. On the fourth day, Rapp waited in the middle stall of three and at the appointed hour his target sat down on his right. Rapp stood on the toilet seat, leaned over the divider, called out the man&#x2019;s name, and then after their eyes met, he smiled and sent a single 9mm hollow-tipped round through the top of the man&#x2019;s head. He fired one more kill shot into the man&#x2019;s brainpan for good measure and calmly left the building. Thirty minutes later, he was on a ferry slicing through the warm morning air of the Aegean Sea, headed for the island of Crete.<br> <br>Most of the kills had been like that. Unsuspecting fools who thought themselves safe after years of the United States doing little or nothing to pursue them for their involvement in various terrorist attacks. Rapp&#x2019;s singular goal was to take the fight to these men. Bleed them until they began to have doubts, until they lay awake at night wondering if they were next. It had become his mission in life. Inaction was what had emboldened these men to continue with their plots to attack innocent civilians. The belief that they were secure to continue to wage their war of terror had given them a smug confidence. Rapp was single-handedly replacing that confidence with fear.<br> <br>By now, they were aware that something was wrong. Too many men had been shot in the head in the last year for it to be a coincidence. Rapp&#x2019;s handler had reported the rumors. Most suspected that the Israelis had resurrected one of their hit teams, and that was fine with Rapp&#x2014;the more disinformation the better. He was not looking for credit. In spite of his hot streak, tonight would be it for a while. The powers that be in Virginia were getting nervous. Too many people were talking. Too many foreign intelligence agencies were allocating assets to look into this rash of deaths among the world&#x2019;s most notorious terrorists and their network of financiers and arms dealers. Rapp was to return stateside for some rest and relaxation when he finished this one. At least that&#x2019;s what Rapp&#x2019;s handler had told him. Even after a quick year, however, he knew how things worked. Rest and relaxation meant that they wanted to observe him. Make sure some part of his psyche hadn&#x2019;t wandered down a dark corridor never to return. The thought brought a smile to Rapp&#x2019;s face. Killing these assholes was the most therapeutic thing he&#x2019;d ever done in his life. It was more effective than a decade of psychotherapy.<br> <br>He placed his hand over his left ear and focused on the tiny transmitter that was relaying the sounds of the luxury hotel suite two floors below. Just like the night before, and the night before that, he could hear the portly Libyan wheezing and snoring. The man was a three-pack-a-day chain smoker. If Rapp could only chase him up a flight of stairs, he might be able to accomplish his task.<br> <br>Rapp followed a delivery van as it quietly passed beneath on the Quai Voltaire. Something was bothering him, but he couldn&#x2019;t place it. He scanned the street for the slightest evidence that anything was out of place and then turned his attention to the tree-lined walking paths that bordered the Seine River. They too were empty. All was as it should be, but still something was gnawing at him. Maybe things had been too easy of late, one kill after another, city after city, and not so much as a single close call. The law of averages told him that sooner or later, something would go wrong, and he would end up in a jam that might land him in a foreign jail or possibly cost him his life. Those two thoughts were always in the back of his mind, and depending on what country he was in, he wasn&#x2019;t sure which would be his preference.<br> <br>There was little room for fear and doubt in what he did. There should be caution and a keen eye to detail, but fear and doubt could incapacitate. He could stand up here all night thinking up excuses not to proceed. Stan Hurley, the tough SOB who had trained him, had warned him about the pitfalls of paralysis by analysis. Rapp thought about the stern warning that Hurley had given him and decided it was more than likely his handler&#x2019;s anxiety. She had warned him that if the slightest thing didn&#x2019;t seem right, he was to abort the mission. An American could not be caught doing this kind of dirty work in Paris. Not ever, and especially not now, given the current political climate.<br> <br>In the big picture, the target was a link. Another name to cross off his list, but to Rapp it was always more personal than the big picture. He wanted to make every last one of these men pay for what they&#x2019;d done. Each kill would grow more difficult, more dangerous, and it didn&#x2019;t bother Rapp in the least. He welcomed the challenge. In fact, he took sincere joy in the fact that these assholes were looking over their shoulder each day and going to sleep every night wondering who was hunting them.<br> <br>Rapp asked himself one more time if he should be concerned that the Libyan was traveling without security. There was a good chance that the man felt safe in his position as his country&#x2019;s oil minister. As an important member of the diplomatic community, he probably thought himself above the dirty games of terrorists and assassins. <i>Well,</i> Rapp thought to himself, <i>once a terrorist, always a terrorist.</i> Dress him up in a suit and tie and put him up in a thousand-dollar-a-night suite in Paris, and he was still a terrorist.<br> <br>Rapp scanned the street and listened to the Libyan snoring like a pig. After half a minute, he made up his mind. The man would not see another sunrise. Rapp began to move in an efficient, almost robotic way as he went over his gear one last time. His silenced Beretta was secured in a shoulder holster under his right arm; two extra magazines were safely tucked away under his left arm; a double-edged four-inch combat knife was sheathed at the small of his back; and a smaller 9mm pistol was strapped to his right ankle. These were merely the offensive weapons he&#x2019;d brought along. There was a small med kit, a radio that was tuned to the hotel&#x2019;s security channel, flex cuffs, and a perfectly forged set of documents that said he was a Palestinian recently immigrated from Amman, Jordan. And then there was the bulletproof vest. Wearing it was one of several things that had been beaten into him during his seemingly never-ending training.<br> <br>Rapp flipped up the collar on his black jacket and pulled a thin black balaclava over his face. He hefted the coil of climbing rope, looked over the edge of the building, and said to himself, &#x201c;Two shots to the head.&#x201d; It was a bit redundant, but that was the point, and the essence of what this entire exercise was about.<br> <br>Rapp gently let the rope play its way out and then swung both legs over the lip of the roof. In one smooth move, he hopped off the ledge and spun 180 degrees. His gloved hands clamped onto the rope and slowed his descent until he had dropped fifteen feet and he could reach out and put one foot on the railing of the balcony. Holding firmly to the rope, he gently stepped down onto the small black iron grating. He was careful to keep himself off to one side despite the fact that the blackout drapes were pulled. Dropping to a knee, he took the rope and brought it around the railing so it would be available should he need to make a quick exit. He had disabled the lock on the balcony door when he&#x2019;d planted the listening device two days earlier. If there was time, he would retrieve the device, but it was nothing special. Rapp always made sure to use devices that couldn&#x2019;t be traced back to one of the high-end manufacturers that Langley used.<br> <br>He had the layout of the suite memorized. It was one big room with a sitting area on the left and king-sized platform bed on the other. Rapp listened to the noises on the other side of the doors. The prostitute was more than likely there, but Rapp couldn&#x2019;t hear her over the obnoxious snoring and wheezing of the Libyan. Everything was as it should be. Rapp drew his Beretta and slowly began to place pressure on the brass door handle with his gloved hand. He moved it from the three o&#x2019;clock position down to five, and then it released without so much as a click.<br> <br>Rapp pulled the door toward him and swung it flat against the side of the building. He placed his free hand on the seam of the blackout curtains and pushed through in a low crouch, his pistol up and sweeping from left to right. It was six steps from the balcony to where his target was sleeping. The bed was up so high that the platform had a step that wrapped around three sides. A massive, gaudy mirror served as the headboard. The elevation put the target at waist height for the six-foot-one Rapp. With the tip of the silencer only four feet from the Libyan&#x2019;s head, Rapp stole a quick glance in hopes that he could locate the prostitute. The best he could do was get a sense that she was somewhere on the other side, buried under a jumble of pillows and blankets. He would never shoot her, but he might have to pistol-whip her in the event she woke up and started screaming.<br> <br>Rapp moved a half step closer and leveled his weapon. He placed the orange dot of his front sight on the bridge of the man&#x2019;s nose and then brought the two rear dots into position. The pressure was already on the trigger, and without so much as the tiniest flash of hesitation, Rapp squeezed and sent a bullet into the man&#x2019;s head. The suppressor jumped one inch, fell back in line, and Rapp fired the second shot.<br> <br>He looked down at the Libyan. The second shot had enlarged the dime-sized hole by half. Death was instantaneous, which meant that the snoring had stopped. In the new silence of the room, Rapp&#x2019;s eyes darted to the jumbled pile on the far side of the bed, and after three seconds of no movement he dropped to his knee and reached around the back of the nightstand. The fingertips of his right hand had just found what he was looking for when he felt the floor beneath him tremble. The vibration was intense enough that Rapp knew it could be caused only by one thing. He withdrew his hand, leaving the listening device where it was, and rose enough so that he could look over the bed to the hotel room&#x2019;s door.<br> <br>There, in the thin strip of light under the door, Rapp saw one shadow pass and then another. He cursed to himself, and was about to make a break toward the balcony, when the door crashed open, flooding the suite with a band of light. As Rapp began to drop, he saw the distinct black barrel of a submachine gun, and then a bright muzzle flash.<br> <br>� 2012 Vince Flynn</p><h2>Bread Machine Baking</h2><p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>Revised and Updated for the Best Electric Bread Machines</strong><p> After Lora Brody and Millie Apter discovered the joys of baking bread in electric bread machines, they decided to create and swap new recipes.

Finally, when even the chatter in the corridor outside the room had died down, she stood up to pull on her jacket.<br><br>"You okay, Angel?" the teacher asked, peering worriedly at her from behind his desk.<br><br>Okay? she repeated silently to herself. How could she be okay after what had happened this morning? And if Mr. English didn't know what was wrong, how was she going to explain it to him? After all, it had happened right there during the first period, just before the bell sounded, when Mr. English asked the class if they wanted to sing "Happy Birthday" to her. "Happy Birthday," like it was still third grade! Didn't he know that none of her classmates even spoke to her except to say mean things? So there she'd sat, in her seat in the last row, her face burning with embarrassment as a horrible silence fell over the room and half the class turned to stare at her. The only thing that saved her from bursting into tears of humiliation was that the bell had rung. Then everyone rushed for the door.<br><br>And now Mr. English wanted to know if she was okay?<br><br>Biting her lip but saying nothing, she hurried toward the door and the safety of the corridor beyond, which with any luck would now be empty.<br><br>"Angel?"<br><br>She heard Mr. English, but was already out of the room, the door swinging shut behind her.<br><br>Angel. What kind of name was Angel?<br><br>For a long time-well, maybe not all that long, but for a while, anyway-she had thought it was a wonderful name, maybe the most wonderful name in the world. Even now, memories of phrases from when she was barely more than a baby echoed softly in her mind.<br><br>Daddy's little Angel.<br><br>Mommy's little Angel.<br><br>Grammy's perfect little Angel.<br><br>It had been Grammy who gave her the very first Halloween costume she could remember. It was a white dress that Angel was certain had been made of satin but her mother insisted was only cheap muslin. But it didn't matter, because it had white sequins sewn all over it that glittered even when she was standing as still as she possibly could. On the back of the dress there were two wings Grammy had made of papier-m�ch� and then covered with white feathers.<br><br>"I've been saving them ever since you were born," Grammy had told her as she carefully fitted the wings onto her tiny three-year-old shoulders. "Some people might tell you they're only seagull feathers, but don't you believe them."<br><br>"But if they didn't come from seagulls, where did they come from?"Angel had asked.<br><br>"Angels," Grammy told her, looking deep into her eyes. "Angels just like you. They come to me when I dream, and leave feathers on my pillow. Feathers from real angels for my own perfect little Angel."<br><br>Angel still had those wings, but they no longer hung on the wall of her room, as they once had. Now they were wrapped in tissue paper and packed away in an old hat box she'd found in the basement of the house they lived in when she was nine, and even though her mother thought they should be thrown away, Angel knew they never would be. They were all she had to remind her of Grammy, who died a little while after that wonderful Halloween when she'd worn the angel costume, and Grammy held her hand and led her up to the porches decorated with jack-o-lanterns. Angel remembered being too shy to knock on the doors herself, and too terrified of the strangers who answered the doors to call out "Trick or treat," so Grammy had done that for her too.<br><br>Then, even before all her Halloween candy was gone, Grammy had died.<br><br>And she had been alone ever since, with only the wonderful feathered wings to remember her grandmother by.</p><h2>The Soul of a New Machine</h2><p>Computers have changed since 1981, when Tracy Kidder memorably recorded the drama, comedy, and excitement of one companys efforts to bring a new microcomputer to market. What has not changed is the feverish pace of the high-tech industry, the go-for-broke approach to business that has caused so many computer companies to win big (or go belly up), and the cult of pursuing mind-bending technological innovations. The Soul of a New Machine is an essential chapter in the history of the machine that revolutionized the world in the twentieth century.</p><p>The computer revolution brought with it new methods of getting work done--just look at today's news for reports of hard-driven, highly-motivated young software and online commerce developers who sacrifice evenings and weekends to meet impossible deadlines. Tracy Kidder got a preview of this world in the late 1970s when he observed the engineers of Data General design and build a new 32-bit minicomputer in just one year. His thoughtful, prescient book, <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i>, tells stories of 35-year-old "veteran" engineers hiring recent college graduates and encouraging them to work harder and faster on complex and difficult projects, exploiting the youngsters' ignorance of normal scheduling processes while engendering a new kind of work ethic.<p> These days, we are used to the "total commitment" philosophy of managing technical creation, but Kidder was surprised and even a little alarmed at the obsessions and compulsions he found. From in-house political struggles to workers being permitted to tease management to marathon 24-hour work sessions, <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i> explores concepts that already seem familiar, even old-hat, less than 20 years later. Kidder plainly admires his subjects; while he admits to hopeless confusion about their work, he finds their dedication heroic. The reader wonders, though, what will become of it all, now and in the future. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the American Book Award, The Soul of a New Machine was a bestseller on its first publication in 1981. With the touch of an expert thriller writer, Tracy Kidder recounts the feverish efforts of a team of Data General researchers to create a new 32-bit superminicomputer. A compelling account of individual sacrifice and human ingenuity, The Soul of a New Machine endures as the classic chronicle of the computer age and the masterminds behind its technological advances.<br> "A superb book," said Robert Pirsig, author of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. "All the incredible complexity and chaos and exploitation and loneliness and strange, half-mad beauty of this field are honestly and correctly drawn." The Washington Post Book World said, "Kidder has created compelling entertainment. He offers a fast, painless, enjoyable means to an initial understanding of computers, allowing us to understand the complexity of machines we could only marvel at before, and to appreciate the skills of the people who create them."<br> The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hardbound editions of important works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torch-bearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.<br><br> Tracy Kidder has written a new Introduction to this Modern Library edition.</p><h2>The Gardener&#39;s Guide to Growing Peonies (Gardener&#39;s Guide Series)</h2><p>A complete practical guide to growing and collecting these magnificent flowering plants and using them to best effect in the garden.

Dust flew in through the open windows and clung to Cara&#x2019;s sweaty face, and the vinyl seat was hot to the touch when she laid her hand against it.Mama pressed the brake pedal, slowing the car to a near stop as they crossed another bridge with a roof over it. A covered bridge,Mama called it.The bumpiness of the wooden planks jarred Cara, making her bounce like she was riding a cardboard box down a set of stairs.<br><br>Mama reached across the seat and ran her hand down the back of Cara&#x2019;s head, probably trying to smooth out one of her cowlicks. No matter how short Mama cut her hair, she said the unrulymop always won the battle. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to visit a...a friend of mine. She&#x2019;s Amish.&#x201d; She placed her index finger on her lips. &#x201c;I need you to do as the mother of Jesus did when it came to precious events. She treasured them in her heart and pondered them. I know you love our diary, and since you turned eight, you&#x2019;ve been determined to write entries about everything, but you can&#x2019;t&#x2014; not this time. No drawing pictures or writing about any part of this trip. And you can&#x2019;t ever tell your father, okay?&#x201d;<br><br>Sunlight bore down on them again as they drove out of the covered bridge. Cara searched the fields for horses. &#x201c;Are we going to your hiding place?&#x201d;<br><br>Cara had a hiding place, one her mother had built for her inside the wall of the attic.They had tea parties in there sometimes when there was money for tea bags and sugar. And when Daddy needed quiet, her mother would silently whisk her to that secret room. If her mama didn&#x2019;t return for her by nightfall, she&#x2019;d sleep in there, only sneaking out for a minute if she needed to go to the bathroom.<br><br>Mama nodded. &#x201c;I told you every girl needs a fun place she can get away to for a while, right?&#x201d;<br><br>Cara nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, this is mine. We&#x2019;ll stay for a couple of days, and if you like it, maybe we&#x2019;ll move here one day&#x2014;just us girls.&#x201d;<br><br>Cara wondered if Mama was so tired of the bill collectors hounding her and Daddy that she was thinking of sneaking away and not even telling him where she was going. The familiar feeling returned&#x2014;that feeling of her insides being Jell-O on a whirlybird ride. She clutched her toy horse even tighter and looked out the window, imagining herself on a stallion galloping into a world where food was free and her parents were happy.<br><br>After they topped another hill, her mother slowed the vehicle and pulled into a driveway. Mama turned off the car. &#x201c;Look at this place, Cara. That old white clapboard house has looked the same since I was a child.&#x201d;<br><br>The shutters hung crooked and didn&#x2019;t havemuch paint left on them. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really small, and it looks like ghosts live here.&#x201d;<br><br>Her mama laughed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called a <i>Daadi Haus</i>, which means it&#x2019;s just for grandparents once their children are grown. It only has a small kitchen, two bedrooms, and a bathroom. This one has been here for many years. You&#x2019;re right&#x2014;it does look dilapidated. Come on.&#x201d;<br><br>Seconds after Cara shut the passenger door, an old woman stepped out from between tall rows of corn. She stared at them as if they were aliens, and Cara wondered if her mama really did know these people. The woman wore a long burgundy dress and no shoes. The wrinkles covering her face looked like a roadmap, with the lines taking on new twists as she frowned. Though it was July and too hot for a toboggan cap, she wore a white one.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Grossmammi Levina, ich bin kumme bsuche. Ich hab aa die Cara mitgebrocht</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>Startled, Cara looked up at her mama.What was she saying? Was it code? Mama wasn&#x2019;t even good at pig Latin.<br><br>The old woman released her apron, and several ears of corn fell to the ground. She hurried up to Mama. &#x201c;Malinda?&#x201d;<br><br>Tears brimmed in Mama&#x2019;s eyes, and she nodded. The older woman squealed, long and loud, before she hugged Mama.<br><br>A lanky boy came running from the rows. &#x201c;Levina, was iss letz?&#x201d; He stopped short, watching the two women for a moment before looking at Cara.<br><br>As he studied her, she wondered if she looked as odd to him as he did to her. She hadn&#x2019;t seen a boy in long black pants since winter ended, and she&#x2019;d never seen one wear suspenders and a straw hat. Why would he work in a garden in a Sunday dress shirt?<br><br>He snatched up several ears of corn the woman had dropped, walked to a wooden wheelbarrow, and dumped them.<br><br>Cara picked up the rest of the ears and followed him. &#x201c;You got a name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ephraim.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can be lots of help if you&#x2019;ll let me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ya ever picked corn before?&#x201d;<br><br>Cara shook her head. &#x201c;No, but I can learn.&#x201d;<br><br>He just stood there, watching her.<br><br>She held out her horse to him. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she a beauty?&#x201d;<br><br>He shrugged. &#x201c;Looks a little worn to me.&#x201d;<br><br>Cara slid the horse into her pocket.<br><br>Ephraim frowned. &#x201c;Can I ask you a question?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you a boy or a girl?&#x201d;<br><br>The question didn&#x2019;t bother her. She got it all the time at school from new teachers or ones who didn&#x2019;t have her in their classes. They referred to her as a young man until they realized she wasn&#x2019;t a boy. Lots of times it worked for her, like when she slipped right past the teacher who was the lavatory monitor and went into the boys&#x2019; bathroom to teach Jake Merrow a lesson about stealing her milk money. She got her money back, and he never told a soul that a girl gave him a fat lip. &#x201c;If I say I&#x2019;m a boy, will you let me help pick corn?&#x201d;<br><br>Ephraim laughed in a friendly way. &#x201c;You know, I used to have a worn horse like the one you showed me. I kept him in my pocket too, until I lost him.&#x201d;<br><br>Cara shoved the horse deeper into her pocket. &#x201c;You lost him?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded. &#x201c;Probably down by the creek where I was fishing. Do you fish?&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen a creek.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never seen one? Where are you from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;New York City. My mama had to borrow a car for us to get beyond where the subway ends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if you&#x2019;re here when the workday is done, I&#x2019;ll show you the creek.We got a rope swing, and if your mama will let you, you can swing out and drop into the deep part. How long are you here for?&#x201d;<br><br>She looked around the place. Her mama and the old woman were sitting under a shade tree, holding hands and talking. Across the road was a barn, and she could see a horse inside it. Green fields went clear to the horizon. She took a deep breath. The air smelled delicious, like dirt, but not city dirt. Like growing-food dirt. Maybe this was where her horse took her when she dreamed. The cornstalks reached for the sky, and her chest felt like little shoes were tap-dancing inside it. She should have known that if her mama liked something, it was worth liking.<br><br>&#x201c;Until it&#x2019;s not a secret anymore, I think.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Chapter One<br></b><i><br>Twenty years later<br><br></i>Sunlight streamed through the bar&#x2019;s dirty windows as the lunch crowd filled the place. Cara set two bottles of beer on the table in front of the familiar faces.<br><br>The regulars knew the rules: all alcoholic drinks were paid for upon delivery. One of the men held a five-dollar bill toward her but kept his eyes on the television. The other took a long drink while he slid a hundred dollar bill across the table.<br><br>She stared at the bill, her heart pounding with desire. If earning money as a waitress wasn&#x2019;t hard enough, Mac kept most of their tips. The money the customer slid across the table wasn&#x2019;t just cash but power. It held the ability for her to fix Lori something besides boiled potatoes next week and to buy her a pair of shoes that didn&#x2019;t pinch her feet.<br><br><i>Would the customer even notice if I short changed him from such a large amount?<br></i><br>Lines of honesty were often blurred by desperation. Cara loathed that she couldn&#x2019;t apply for government help and that she had to uproot every few months to stay a few steps ahead of a maniac. Moving always cost money. Fresh security deposits on ever-increasing rents. Working time lost as she searched for another job&#x2014;each one more pathetic than the one before it. Mike had managed to steal everything from her but mere existence. And her daughter.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get your change.&#x201d; <i>All of it</i>. She took the money.<br><br>&#x201c;Cara.&#x201d; Mac&#x2019;s gruff voice sailed across the room. From behind the bar he motioned for her. &#x201c;Phone!&#x201d; He shook the receiver at her. &#x201c;Kendal says it&#x2019;s an emergency.&#x201d;<br><br>Every sound echoing inside the wooden-and-glass room ceased. She hurried toward him, snaking around tables filled with people.<br><br>&#x201c;Keep it short.&#x201d; Mac passed the phone to her and returned to serving customers.<br><br>&#x201c;Kendal, what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He found us.&#x201d; Her friend&#x2019;s usually icy voice shook, and Cara knew she was more frightened than she&#x2019;d been the other times. <br><br><i>How could he after all we&#x2019;ve done to hide?</i> &#x201c;We got a letter at our new place?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.Worse.&#x201d; Kendal&#x2019;s words quaked. &#x201c;He was here. Broke the lock and came inside looking for you. He ransacked the place.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s getting meaner, Cara. He ripped open all the cushions, turned mattresses, emptied drawers and boxes. He found your leather book and...and insisted I stay while he made himself at home and read through it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to call the police.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know we can&#x2019;t...&#x201d; Kendal dropped the sentence, and Cara heard her crying.<br><br>They both knew that going to the police would be a mistake neither of them would survive.<br><br>One of the waitresses plunked a tray of dirty dishes onto the counter. &#x201c;Get off the phone, princess.&#x201d;<br><br>Cara plugged her index finger into her ear, trying desperately to think. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Lori?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they moved her to after-school care.&#x201d; Through the phone line Cara heard a car door slam. They didn&#x2019;t own a car.<br><br>A male voice asked, &#x201c;Where to?&#x201d;<br><br>Cara gripped the phone tighter. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br><br>Kendal sobbed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I can&#x2019;t take this anymore. All we do is live in fear and move from one part of New York to another. He&#x2019;s...he&#x2019;s not after me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know he&#x2019;s trying to isolate me from everyone. Please, Kendal.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I...I&#x2019;m sorry. I can&#x2019;t help you anymore,&#x201d; Kendal whispered. &#x201c;The cab&#x2019;s waiting.&#x201d;<br><br>Disbelief settled over her. &#x201c;How long ago did he break in?&#x201d;<br><br>From behind Cara a shadow fell across the bar, engulfing her. &#x201c;Hi, Care Bear.&#x201d;<br><br>She froze. Watching the silhouette, she noted how tiny she was in comparison.<br><br>Mike&#x2019;s thick hand thudded a book onto the bar beside her. He removed his hand, revealing her diary. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to do it this way, Care Bear. You know that about me. But I had to get inside your place to try to find answers for why you keep running off.&#x201d;<br><br>She swallowed a wave of fear and faced him but couldn&#x2019;t find her voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Johnny&#x2019;s been dead for a while. Now you&#x2019;re here...with me. &#x201d; His massive body loomed over her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be willing to forget that you ever picked that loser. We could start fresh. Come on, beautiful, I can help you.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Help me? </i>The only person Mike wanted to help was himself&#x2014;right into her bed.<br><br>&#x201c;Please...leave me alone.&#x201d;<br><br>His steely grin unnerved her, and silence fell in themidst of the bar&#x2019;s noise. Thoughts of how to escape him exploded in her mind like fireworks shooting out in all directions. But before she could focus, they disappeared into the darkness, leaving only trails of smoke. Fear seemed to take on its own life form, one threatening to stalk her forever.<br><br>He tapped her diary. &#x201c;I know it all now, even where you&#x2019;d hide if you ran again, which is not happening, right?&#x201d; The threatening tone in his voice was undeniable, and panic stole her next breath. &#x201c;I know your daughter just as well as you do now. What happens if I show up one day after school with a puppy named Shamu?&#x201d;<br><br>Cara&#x2019;s legs gave way. Without any effort he held her up by her elbow.<br><br>After she&#x2019;d spent years of hide-and-seek in hopes of protecting Lori, now he knew Lori&#x2019;s name, her school, her likes and dislikes. Shaking, she looked around for help. Bottles of various sizes and shapes filled the bar&#x2019;s shelves.The television blared. Blank faces stared at it. The man who had given her the hundred-dollar bill glanced at her before turning to another waitress.<br><br>Apathy hung in the air, like smog in summer, reminding her that there was no help for people like her and Lori. On a good day there were distractions that made them forget for a few hours. Even as her mind whirled, life seemed to move in slow motion. She had no one.<br><br>&#x201c;You know how I feel about you.&#x201d; His voice softened to a possessive whisper, making her skin crawl. &#x201c;Why do you gotta make this so tough?&#x201d; Mike ran his finger down the side of her neck. &#x201c;My patience is gone, Care Bear.&#x201d;<br><br>Where could she hide now? Somewhere she could afford that he wouldn&#x2019;t know about and couldn&#x2019;t track her to. A piece of a memory&#x2014;washed in colorless fog&#x2014;wavered before her like a sheet on a clothesline. <br><br>An apron. A head covering. An old woman. Rows of tall corn.<br><br>He dug his fingers into her biceps. Pain shot through her, and the disjointed thoughts disappeared. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare leave again. I&#x2019;ll find you. You know I can...every time.&#x201d;His eyes reflected that familiar mixture of spitefulness and uncertainty as he willed her to do his bidding. &#x201c;I call the shots. Not you. Not dear old Johnny. Me.&#x201d;<br><br>But maybe he didn&#x2019;t. A tender sprig of hope took root. If she could latch on to that memory&#x2014;if it was even real&#x2014;she might have a place to go. Somewhere Mike couldn&#x2019;t find her and she wouldn&#x2019;t owe anyone her life in exchange for food and shelter. Doubts rippled through her, trying to dislodge her newfound hope. It was probably a movie she&#x2019;d watched. Remembering any part of her life, anything true, before her mama died seemed as impossible as getting free of Mike. She&#x2019;d been only eight when her mother was killed by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a street. Things became so hard after that, anything before seemed like shadows and blurs.<br><br>As she begged for answers, faint scenes appeared before her. A kitchen table spread with fresh food. A warm breeze streaming through an unfamiliar window. Sheets flapping on a clothesline. Muffled laughter as a boy jumped into a creek.<br><br>Was it just a daydream? Or was it somewhere she&#x2019;d once been, a place she couldn&#x2019;t reach because she couldn&#x2019;t remember?<br><br>Her heart raced. She had to find the answer.<br><br>Mike pulled the phone from her hand, a sneer overriding the insecurity he tried hard to cover. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re more afraid of one thing than anything else. And I know what that is.&#x201d; He eased the receiver into its cradle and flipped the diary open. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t want nothing to cause the social workers to take her...&#x201d; He tapped his huge finger on a photo of Lori. &#x201c;Think about it, Care Bear. And I&#x2019;ll see you at your place when your shift is over.&#x201d; He strode out the door.<br><br>Cara slumped against the counter. No matter how hard she tried, she landed in the same place over and over again in the clutches of a crazy man.<br><br>In spite of the absurdity of it, she longed for a cigarette. It would help her think and calm her nerves.<br><br>Clasped in her fist was the cash the two men had given for their drinks. She rubbed it between her fingers. If she slipped out the back door, no one at Mac&#x2019;s would have a clue where she went. She could pick up Lori and disappear.</p><h2>The Truth Machine: The Blockchain and the Future of Everything</h2><p><p><b>"Views differ on bitcoin, but few doubt the transformative potential of Blockchain technology. <i>The Truth Machine</i> is the best book so far on what has happened and what may come along.

In this appealing and elegant book, Sweeting plumbs Indian summer's use in literature as a symbol of second chance, rebirth, or reprieve before the onset of a harsher season. <br><br>Well researched and charmingly written, Beneath the Second Sun is the first book to systematically treat the history and uses of Indian summer imagery in American life. The author focuses on the ways in which New Englanders have embraced the season, and he places the celebration of the season's beauty and its melancholy qualities within the context of Anglo-Native American relations. Sweeting does not try to locate the original definition of Indian summer, rather he explores the far more interesting ways in which the season has been imagined and described in American culture. <br><br>Popular authors including Philip Freneau, Susan Cooper, Lydia Sigourney, John Greenleaf Whittier, Francis Parkman Oliver, Wendell Holmes, and, especially, Henry David Thoreau, Emily Dickinson, and William Dean Howells freely employ Indian summer imagery in their works. In the context of modern American Studies, Sweeting's study is part of a "post-modern" scholarly discussion of how tangible realities such as climate are mediated, even forged, by social needs. Sweeting further investigates the imaginative, early-nineteenth-century "invention" of New England regional identity and integrates traditional American Studies literary and historical concerns with a contemporary interest in the environment and sense of place. <br><br>Sweeting's graceful, lively, and accessible style beckons not only scholars of American literature and the nineteenth century but any traveler seeking the glories of autumn in New England.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. 7 b &amp; w illus.ADAM SWEETING is an associate professor of Humanities at the College of General Studies, Boston University.

Long ago, he made a place for himself as a captain of the Jhereg, the noble house that runs the rackets in the great imperial city of Adrilankha. But love, revolution, betrayal, and revenge ensued, and for years now Vlad has been a man on the run, struggling to stay a step ahead of the Jhereg who would kill him without hesitation.<br><br>Now Vlad's back in Adrilankha. The rackets he used to run are now under the control of the mysterious "Left Hand of the Jhereg"--a secretive cabal of women who report to no man. His ex-wife needs his help.

A perfect gift for teachers and for reading students of any age. Patricia Polacco is now one of America's most loved children's book creators, but once upon a time, she was a little girl named Trisha starting school. Trisha could paint and draw beautifully, but when she looked at words on a page, all she could see was jumble. It took a very special teacher to recognize little Trisha's dyslexia: Mr. Falker, who encouraged her to overcome her reading disability. Patricia Polacco will never forget him, and neither will we. This inspiring story is available in a deluxe slipcased edition, complete with a personal letter to readers from Patricia Polacco herself.

But how did a family of Tudor sheep farmers reach the ranks of the upper aristocracy by the time of the Restoration? The Spencers have quietly adapted from one generation to the next, sweeping up heiresses and magnificent estates, buying great libraries and art-then building London&#39;s most beautiful Palladian mansion to house them. The Spencers were also virtuosi of a particular art of prime importance to any aristocracy-the art of dynastic marriage. This is the story of how the Spencers attained their power, how they wielded it, and the bitter twist of fate by which they finally achieved their greatest dynastic marriage of all in 1981-the union of Diana Spencer with Charles Mountbatten Windsor.</p><p>John Pearson is the author of several novels and biographies including The Life of Ian Fleming, Stags and Serpents: The History of the Dukes of Devonshire and The Profession of Violence: The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins, which was awarded the Edgar Allan Poe Special Award by the Mystery Writers of America.This is a lively if superficial overview of the lives and times of Princess Diana's illustrious family through 500 years, from the Tudor age to the present. Gaining and losing vast fortunes; making shrewd, status-enhancing marriages; and jockeying for social and political power are the recurring themes of this family saga, whose subjects rose from being wealthy farmers during the reign of Henry VII to ranking among the most prosperous and prominent families in the land by the 18th century, only to see both their wealth and their status decline throughout the Victorian and contemporary eras--until Diana, third daughter of the eighth earl, made her "fairy-tale" marriage into the royal family. Including such notables as Sarah Churchill and the infamous 18th-century duchess of Marlborough, whose carefully calculated scheming made the family one of the richest in the land, the Spencer clan is replete with colorful characters. That Princess Diana herself drew strength from this ancestral heritage, as Pearson claims, is undoubtable; more dubious, however, are his repeated assertions that various facets of Diana's own character are direct inheritances from one ancestor or another. This suggestion that biology is destiny culminates in the proposition--based on the observation that Princes William and Harry look more like their mother than their father--that the Spencer genes have superseded those of the Windsors and will be instrumental in shaping the future of the British monarchy. While this claim that the Spencer family history yields vital insights into the destinies of Diana and her children seems somewhat overstated, those who admire the late princess of Wales and those who are drawn to accounts of English dynastic history will find the story of the Spencers engrossing.

Morris also defends the view that records were kept from the time of Adam and includes implications for scripture use not commonly considered.</p><p><p>A prolific and influential scholar known to believers and skeptics alike as "the father of modern creation science," Dr. Henry M. Morris truly was a man of science and a staunch man of God. He was even said to have set the terms of debate about evolution for the second half of the 20th century by one Pulitzer Prize-winning academician. Dr. Morris began his serious study of the Bible in the 1930s and authoring books in the 1940s, but it was his landmark work, co-authored with Dr. John Whitcomb, titled <em>The Genesis Flood</em> in 1961 that influenced generations to begin discovering the fallacies of evolution and the biblical truth of creation.</p> <p>With over 60 books, founding and leading the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), Dr. Morris' death in 2006 was a profound loss to millions.</p> <p>Dr. Morris created a thriving legacy that continues to equip many Christians to be able to defend the accuracy and authority of Scripture today. The new <em>Henry Morris Study Bible</em> and other resources that he developed remain essential sources of knowledge and understanding for believers.</p><p>The gospel without the assurance of a Creator-God has no foundation (Rev. 4:11, 14:6-7). This book will embolden those whose faith has been undermined by evolutionary dogma. It gives exegesis of all the more difficult sections, furnishes deep expository dividends, and yields rich spiritual insights. It should prove to be a classic for generations to come, should the Lord delay His coming, and will become a resource for pastors, teachers, and lay leaders throughout the Christian family.</p> --Henry Morris III - Eldest son of Henry Morris</p><h2>After Jackie: Pride, Prejudice, and Baseball&#39;s Forgotten Heroes: An Oral History</h2><p><strong>To commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the breaking of baseball's color barrier, an exploration of Jackie Robinson's impact and legacy by the people whose lives were transformed by his courage</strong><p>When Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, he forever changed the game of baseball -- and America itself. In <em>After Jackie</em>, author Cal Fussman traces Robinson's enormous legacy in sports, politics, and the civil rights movement through the men (and women) who came after him. With moving and intimate interviews of more than one hundred former major league players of African-American descent, as well as such luminaries as Jimmy Carter, Muhammad Ali, and Walter Cronkite, among others, <em>After Jackie</em> recalls the day one man altered history for so many, and the history that followed.</p></p><p>Author <b>Cal Fussman</b> is uniquely qualified to bring <i>After Jackie</i> to vivid life. As a writer for <i>ESPN The Magazine</i> and <i>Esquire</i>, he has in recent years transformed oral history into a virtual art form, conducting probing interviews with many of the men who have shaped America's last half century: Jimmy Carter, Robert DeNiro, Jack Welch, Muhammad Ali, General Tommy Franks, Robert McNamara, Donald Trump, Ted Kennedy, Sumner Redstone, George Steinbrenner, Jeff Bezos, Al Pacino and Rudy Giuliani to name a few. In the world of sport, he has profiled Yao Ming, Serena Williams and LeBron James. A graduate of the University of Missouri Journalism School in 1978, Fussman has swum over an 18-foot Tigershark, boxed against world champion Julio Cesar Chavez, run the New York marathon and received nearly perfect scores as a contestant at the Jack Daniel's World Championship barbecue tournament. He lives with his family in Chapel Hill, N.C."Rather than recounting the trials of Jackie Robinson's life, Fussman focuses on the extent of his cultural impact. By incorporating anecdotes from notable members of twentieth century Americana, including Bill Cosby, Walter Cronkite and Ken Burns, the book explores Robinson's perpetually swelling legacy instead of his linear life. It's a fascinating way to go about a biography. Fussman reveals Robinson's entrance into major league baseball to be bigger than sports and ultimately about more than just racial divisions." -- <i>Esquire</i><br><br>"The Pitch: A look at race in American through the prism of baseball, from Jackie Robinson's debut to Hank Aaron's 715th home run. <br> Curveball: The Dodgers literally stole Robinson from the Kansas City Monarchs, subsequent poaching led to the Negro Leagues demise.<br> Final Score: Players describe daily humiliations (a clubhouse manager used a long stick to pick up Curt Flood's uniform), epitomizing a sad tradition of injustice that still stings." -- <i>Entertainment Weekly, Grade: A</i></p><h2>Showcase Presents: The Spectre Vol. 1</h2><p>Originally written by Jerry Siegel, co-creator of Superman, in the 1940s, The Spectre is a ghost-like hero who was originallyPolice Detective Jim Corrigan.

He also tries to make some birthday soup, and then tries to fly to the moon.</p><p>This is the first I Can Read Book ever, and the first of five classic Little Bear books, expressly designed for beginning readers. Elsa Holmelund Minarik and Maurice Sendak teamed up to create these simple stories that are deeply comforting and lovingly playful. In one story, "Birthday Soup," Little Bear cannot find his mother and presumes she has forgotten his birthday. With the prospect of guests arriving and no cake in sight, he sets out to make birthday soup (all his friends like soup). Just as the gathering is sitting down for soup, Mother Bear shows up with a big, beautiful birthday cake. "I never did forget your birthday, and I never will," she says to her son as he hugs her leg. In "Little Bear Goes to the Moon," Little Bear declares that he will fly to the moon in his new space helmet. Mother Bear tells him to be back by lunch, and he is. The gentle, teasing repartee between Little Bear and his mother will delight young readers, and the spacious layout and large type will encourage them to keep on reading! <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i><p>Mother Bear is always there</p><p>When it is cold, Mother Bear knows just the right coat to keep Little Bear warm.

From peasants to princes, no one was untouched by the spiritual and intellectual upheaval of this era. Martin Luther&#39;s challenge to church authority forced Christians to examine their beliefs in ways that shook the foundations of their religion. The subsequent divisions, fed by dynastic rivalries and military changes, fundamentally altered the relations between ruler and ruled. Geographical and scientific discoveries challenged the unity of Christendom as a belief-community. Europe, with all its divisions, emerged instead as a geographical projection. It was reflected in the mirror of America, and refracted by the eclipse of Crusade in ambiguous relationships with the Ottomans and Orthodox Christianity. Chronicling these dramatic changes, Thomas More, Shakespeare, Montaigne and Cervantes created works which continue to resonate with us. Christendom Destroyed is a rich tapestry that fosters a deeper understanding of Europe&#39;s identity today. &#39;The Penguin History of Europe series ... is one of contemporary publishing&#39;s great projects&#39; New Statesman</p><p>Mark Greengrass is Professor Emeritus at the University of Sheffield.

The travel account which he published in his native Dutch in 1655 recounted the six voyages which had taken him to the Mediterranean, the Far East, Newfoundland, the Caribbean, and South and North America. Born in La Rochelle to Dutch parents in 1593, he became a trained artillery master, fluent in several European languages, a skilled navigator, a shrewd man of business, an autodidact with an observant eye. It was not his fault that his colonial enterprises&nbsp;&#x2013; on the &#x2018;South&#x2019; (Delaware) river (1633), Oyapock river in Guyana (1634) and Staten Island (1638&#x2013;43)&nbsp;&#x2013; all failed. Sponsors let him down, the local populations were difficult to manage, and competing ventures were hostile. De Vries knew where his loyalties lay. His homeland was in the Low Countries, the town of Hoorn his <i>patria</i>. If he had succeeded in establishing a colonial &#x2018;patroonship&#x2019;, he would have modelled it on the estates of the landed gentry of Holland as a part of the &#x2018;New Netherland&#x2019; to which he often referred. He was a Calvinist Protestant who had a hand in building the first Christian church on Staten Island. De Vries understood Europe in a wider world. Landing at St John&#x2019;s, Newfoundland in 1620, after marvelling at the monumental icebergs he saw en route, he recounted the Dutch, Basque, Portuguese and English vessels that he had met, fishing and trading in those waters. With an eye already acclimatized by his reading of other travelogues, he accommodated himself to local Indian customs. Visiting the governor of the new English colonies along the James river in 1640, he was welcomed with a glass of Venetian wine and sat down with another English colonist who had also been in the East Indies in the late 1620s. &#x2018;I looked at him well, and he at me,&#x2019; says de Vries. And he heard the colonist say &#x2018;that mountains could not meet one another, but men who go and see the world can&#x2019;.</p> <p>By their clothes, their food and their demeanour, these were Europeans, aware that they were on another continent, having (as de Vries said) &#x2018;steered the earth&#x2019;s four corners&#x2019;. De Vries&#x2019;s career reflected the wider geographical horizons of his generation, the possibilities and challenges which they opened up, an extraordinary pluralism of contact and communication that challenged old loyalties and senses of belonging. This new sense of Europe as a geographical entity, fashioned in a reflection of the wider world, would not have existed a century before. This eclipse of the older notion of &#x2018;Christendom&#x2019; by &#x2018;Europe&#x2019; in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and the extraordinary changes that went with it, is the subject of this book.</p> <p>Christendom conjures up&nbsp;&#x2013; like Camelot&nbsp;&#x2013; an imagined past. In the Middle Ages, the Latin terms for Christendom (<i>Christianitas</i> or <i>Corpus Christianorum</i>) delineated something else: an imagined present and future for a world united by its beliefs and aspirations. That belief-community emerged along with the fall of the Roman empire in the west. The Christianity that took root amid what remained of that empire was initially only the western fringe of a much wider Christian world whose heartland lay further east, towards the Middle East and in the still-active eastern (Byzantine) Roman empire. Gradually, however, and by a process of mutual estrangement, eastern and western Christianity drew apart until, in 1054, the pope in Rome and the patriarch in Constantinople mutually excommunicated one other. Following that big divide, Latin Christians were henceforth separated from Orthodox Christians in the Greek archipelago, the Balkans and Russia to form western Christendom.</p> <p>In the first millennium of western Christianity, Christendom developed without any elaborate notion of where its centre lay, and therefore where its peripheries were to be found. It existed (to borrow the phrases of a distinguished medievalist) as a series of &#x2018;micro-Christendoms&#x2019; held together like a &#x2018;geodesic dome&#x2019;, composed of self-contained segments. The traffic of &#x2018;symbolic goods&#x2019; (holy relics, but also holy people, such as missionaries and saints) carried the charisma of holy power from one place to another and, with it, the values and aspirations of the belief-community from one segment to another. Then, in the Central Middle Ages, and following the rupture with the East, western Christendom developed a more elaborate sense of centre and periphery with the full emergence of two geographical and ideological units: the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. Their claims to authority were forged competitively by theologians, lawyers, political theorists and intellectuals in an atmosphere of confident universalism. That ideal was supported by the economic transformations of the period, the impressive growth of markets and inter-regional and international trade, and by the marriages and diplomatic alliances of the aristocracy. &#x2018;Christendom&#x2019; was how learned contemporaries in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries understood the world of Latin Christians in western Europe.</p> <p>The Roman Catholic Church was the central pillar of the belief-community in Latin Christianity. The intellectual �lites of the latter were formed around an international language (Latin, as opposed to Greek) as well as a common curriculum (centred in matters of philosophy and logic on the works of Aristotle) and ways of study (scholasticism). Papal envoys shared with princely advisers common theocratic and bureaucratic conceptions of how power was derived, exercised and legitimated. The Crusades became western Christendom&#x2019;s most ambitious project. Above all, Latin Christianity was expressed in inherited and practised beliefs, mapped onto that pre-existent multi-dimensional sacred landscape of shrines, pilgrimage sites, saint cults and festivals. Baptism was a universal rite of initiation. Those who were not baptized Christians (Jews, Muslims) were a significant presence in western Christendom&#x2019;s margins in the Central Middle Ages, tolerated precisely because they were <i>not</i> part of the belief-community. But, as Christian kingdoms pushed the frontiers of Latin Christianity southwards in Spain and southern Italy, their significance as exemplifying alien forces from those who did not belong to Christendom seemed to increase.</p> <p>Christendom was a reflexive construction that felt easily threatened. In reality, its most dangerous enemy was not non-Christians. Its power-brokers were most vulnerable from a different and disparate constituency&nbsp;&#x2013; from those with particular, local loyalties to whom the overarching aspirations of Christendom meant little or nothing. Across the landmass of western Europe, over and against the mechanisms of the universal order of the Holy Roman Empire (the dominion located in central Europe whose title indicated its claims to continuity with the Roman empire and a temporal form of universal dominion) and Church lay thousands of villages and parishes, their inhabitants often carrying burdens of obligation to their manorial lords which made them serfs. These communities were joined by towns, benefiting from the economic transformations of the Central Middle Ages.

For Leon, patron of conductor Alan Curtis and his celebrated orchestra Il Complesso Barocco, that usually means the work of her favorite composer, George Frideric Handel.<br><br>Over the years, Leon has noticed that the great musician filled his operas with arias that make reference to animals; rich in symbolism, the perceived virtues and vices of the lion, bee, nightingale, snake, elephant, and tiger, among others, resonate in his works. In <i>Handel&#x2019;s Bestiary</i>, Leon draws on her love of Handel and her expertise in medieval bestiaries illustrated collections of animal stories to assemble a bestiary of her own. Twelve chapters trace twelve animals through history, mythology, and the arias. Each is joined by whimsical original illustrations by German painter Michael Sowa, and an accompanying CD includes each aria, expertly recorded by Il Complesso Barocco. A fascinating, utterly original book, <i>Handel&#x2019;s Bestiary</i> springs to life with Leon&#x2019;s knowledge, passion, and wit.</p><p><b>International Praise for <i>Handel's Bestiary</i></b><br><br> A wonderful book.

Naturally a CD with all twelve animal arias is included musical fun, with enchanting pictures by the German painter and illustrator Michael Sowa.&#x201d; <i>Hamburger Abendblatt</i> (Germany)<br><br> A charming little compendium. As clever as it is entertaining. Leon doesn&#x2019;t turn to modern biologists to make the case for her menagerie. Rather she reminds us what Pliny and Herodotus knew about lions, that in the Middle Ages people thought bees were a small kind of bird, and describes - without being in the least patronizing - the bewilderment with which 18th century Europe saw its first elephant trunks.&#x201d; <i>Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</i> (Germany)<br><br> A great reading and listening pleasure.&#x201d; <i>Ruhr Nachrichten</i> (Germany)<br><br> A total work of art&#x2019; with text, music, and beautiful illustrations by Michael Sowa Donna Leon manages to combine three things in her book: 1. her profound knowledge of ancient nature writing (such as Pliny the Elder) and medieval bestiaries (e.g. Isidore of Seville), 2. Her passion for George Frideric Handel, and 3. her years of friendship with the conductor and Handel expert Alan Curtis. Most whimsical and linguistically at the highest level.

Reprint.</p><p>Grade 1-3-- A little girl recounts the story of her family's life in Brooklyn at the beginning of the century. Her prosperous father builds houses so they can afford to vacation on Coney Island and Long Island, where her imagination blooms. She wishes with the waves and decides to pursue her love of drawing and become an artist when she grows up. Hattie's large extended family gathers for Sunday dinners and holidays, and Cooney fills her graceful prose with details of their daily lives: what they ate, the composition of the furniture, the snippets of German dialect. Her stately paintings, whose landscapes and figures call to mind Miss Rumphius (Penguin, 1982), illuminate these details with warmth and rich tones. While old-fashioned life in a rich household may be foreign to most readers, a child's dream, like Hattie's, is a universal one. The fairly lengthy text and follow-your-calling theme are leavened by Cooney's humorous touches and luminous full-page paintings. The nostalgic mood and subject lend themselves fully to the study of family history, immigration, or a unit on New York. Ornamental endpages like stained glass portend the elegance of Hattie's world. --Marianne Pilla, formerly at Upper Dublin Public Library, Dresher, PA<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Readers have come to expect a great deal from this talented Caldecott Medalist ( Ox-Cart Man ; Miss Rumphius ). Even her most demanding fans will be captivated by the richly detailed paintings that illustrate this heartwarming narrative. Based on her mother's childhood, this somewhat autobiographical account glows with the rich traditions of familial love. Hattie, whose parents came to this country from Germany, lives in Brooklyn during the winter months, and spends the summers in Far Rockaway--in a glorious, sprawling house surrounded by water. But wherever she is, Hattie wants to spend all of her time painting. With the passing years, as Hattie's father becomes wealthier and her surroundings grow even more luxurious, her dream of being an artist becomes increasingly important to her. And, as a young woman, she does what she did as a girl: she listens to the surf crashing onto the Brooklyn shore. " ' You will make beautiful, beautiful pictures ,' said the wild waves." Cooney's lucid, poetic text and striking artwork evoke both the simplicity and the elegance of a bygone era.

Leslie Brooke, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, John Lawson, Arthur Rackham and many more appear together in 55 full-color and 34 black-and-white pieces.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 3 At first glance, this book appears to be primarily for collectors, and it will appeal to that audience. There are, however, many enjoyable and rewarding ways to share this work with children. The Mother Goose rhymes included are among the most familiar; but the illustrations, selected from books published from the 1870s through the 1930s, are rich in their varied interpretations of these rhymes. Sometimes they are totally different in content, as with the pictures accompanying "Pat-a-Cake" or "This Little Pig Went to Market," in which one illustration portrays the more literal interpretation while the other shows the activity or baby game associated with the text. Thus, readers see Brooke's bold, opulent pig with market basket on his arm alongside an anonymous artist's image of an older child playing with a younger child's toes.

In other instances, the age ("Curly Locks"), the gender ("Baa, Baa, Black Sheep"), or the mood ("Little Miss Muffet") of human characters differ.

Pushing open a heavy steel door, he saw an overcast May sky, his first glimpse of daylight in over a week. Then he gasped in astonishment at the twisted steel, broken concrete, and rubble that surrounded him . . . all that was left of the Reichschancellery. The Allied bombing had been unrelenting, pounding Berlin day and night without letting up, until much of the city had been reduced to ashes. An ubiquitous layer of dust and smoke, combined with the smell of rotting corpses and seared flesh, created a living hell. Von Schverdt breathed the foul air deeply, enjoying it, tasting it with the tip of his tongue. He loved the smell of war, relished it, was born for it. If only that madman, Hitler, had not proven to be such a weak vessel, things might have been different. If only someone else with more vitality had been chosen . . .He let his thoughts slip away as his adjutant, who carried two overstuffed satchels of papers, caught up with him. Von Schverdt picked his way through the rubble to where the garden had once been. There he came upon a small group of Nazi SS who were dousing two bodies with gasoline. A captain who noticed Von Schverdt snapped to attention. &#39;Heil, Hitler!&#39; he shouted as another soldier threw a match on the gasoline which exploded in a rush of flames. &#39;Look around you, you idiot! The war is over,&#39; Von Schverdt said, and glared at the man. The captain, unsure how to react, remained at attention. Von Schverdt walked closer to the shallow pit and looked at the bodies of Adolph Hitler and Eva Braun, his mistress. He gathered a mouthful of saliva and spat toward the flaming bodies, then pivoted on the heels of his boots and walked away. He turned up the sleeve of his black leather greatcoat and glanced at his watch. It was almost five. He had less than an hour to meet the Americans and surrender. A burst of machine gun fire sounded very close, and he reacted with a start. The Russians will be here soon. That realization made him hurry toward a car that was waiting nearby. Shortly after Hitler had committed suicide by shooting himself, General Wolfgang Von Schverdt had made a series of telephone calls to the Americans from his private room in the Fuehrer&#39;s bunker. He had offered them information, and as he had expected, they had responded eagerly. Others in the bunker had begun to flee, knowing that capture by the Russians would mean imprisonment or death. Those remaining in the bunker had all agreed that it would be better to surrender to the Americans than to fall into the hands of the Red Army. Von Schverdt stepped next to the waiting car. He glanced at the driver. Little more than a boy, he thought. &#39;Heil, Hitler,&#39; the youth blurted. Von Schverdt smiled with feigned affection. &#39;Heil, Hitler,&#39; he responded, and returned the salute. His adjutant, Heinz, struggled with two bulging satchels, put them down a moment to rest, and then, getting a fresh grip, continued toward the car. Von Schverdt leaned against the car and watched as the man approached. &#39;Put them in the back,&#39; Von Schverdt ordered as he stepped away from the car. &#39;Ja vol,&#39; Heinz puffed, as he set the briefcases down and opened the rear door of the car. He lifted one of them, set it on the floor of the backseat, and then turned to retrieve the other. Von Schverdt watched Heinz&#39;s every move, as he slowly undid the leather strap on his holster and brought the P.38 to his side, fitting the silencer to it. It&#39;s a pity, he thought, Heinz has been loyal. Still . . . Von Schverdt waited until the man had finished his task and faced him, awaiting new orders. Von Schverdt raised the handgun and Heinz took a step backward, a mixture of terror and confusion filling his face. &#39;No, Herr Von Schver---&#39; Von Schverdt fired once, and the bullet went neatly through the forehead of the man, the force of it driving him into the rear door of the car, where his lifeless body slumped to the ground. Von Schverdt moved, catlike, to the driver&#39;s door, opened it, and caught the boy by the oversized sleeve of his uniform, and yanked him out of the car. The boy fell in a heap at Von Schverdt&#39;s feet and began to claw at his boots, crying out for mercy. Von Schverdt fired once and the boy lay still. He unfastened the silencer, reholstered his sidearm, and as he did so, noticed that a few spots of blood had splattered on his boots. He went over and wiped them off on the dead boy&#39;s pant legs. That done, he slid into the driver&#39;s seat and sped off to his meeting place with the Americans. The drive was treacherous. More than once he fired his gun to ward off those attempting to hijack his car. At one point a group of fleeing women and children clogged the road. Von Schverdt held his hand on the horn, but didn&#39;t slow the car. Women and children scrambled to get out of the way. One old woman tripped and fell on the road in front of the speeding car. Von Schverdt ran over her, not even glancing in the rearview mirror as the car sped on. Desperate times require desperate measures, he reminded himself. There&#39;s nothing left . . . They&#39;ve destroyed everything, he thought, as the car rolled by block after block of leveled, smoldering buildings. He had trouble getting his bearings, as many of the street signs were missing, and most of the familiar landmarks that would have aided him had vanished. He stopped the car and looked around, trying to get a sense of where he was. Nothing here . . . But wait. He noticed the base of a statue by the side of the road, all that was left of a beautiful bronze sculpture he had once admired. He turned the car, stepped hard on the gas pedal, and the car lurched forward. Only a few more miles and then, the Americans. The thought made him anxious. How much of his work had been destroyed, or discovered? He gripped the steering wheel tighter. A short time later he saw a roadblock with an American flag flying alongside it and a dozen armed American GIs brandishing rifles. To the left a machine gun nest was lined by rows of sandbags. Von Schverdt slowed the car and stopped twenty yards away from the roadblock. He opened the door of the car and stepped out, being careful to raise his hands over his head as he did so. One of the Americans shouted to him in very bad German, &#39;Ubergeben sie sich mit ihren hande hoch!&#39; (Surrender with your hands up.) Von Schverdt raised his hands higher and stood motionless. More shouting, this time from behind the roadblock. Four GIs approached.</p><h2>Taking Fire</h2><p>She dances on the edge of life...and death&nbsp;<br><br>Not all are meant to walk in the light.

Visit her online at www.LindsayMcKenna.com.The SEAL team below, where Marine Corps Sergeant Khatereh Shinwari hid in her sniper hide, was in danger. The June sun was almost setting in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan. Khat made a slow, sweeping turn to the right with her .300 Win Mag rifle along the rocky scree slope. She spotted fifteen Taliban waiting behind boulders to jump the four-man SEAL team climbing up the nine-thousand-foot slope.<br><br>Lips thinning, Khat watched the inevitable. She knew the team was looking for Sattar Khogani, the Hill tribe chieftain who was wreaking hell on earth to the Shinwari tribe. Her tribe. Her blood.<br><br>Pulling the satellite phone toward her, she punched in some numbers, waiting for her SEAL handler, Commander Jim Hutton, from J-bad, Jalalabad, to answer.<br><br>"Dover Actual."<br><br>"Archangel Actual." Khat spoke quietly, apprising Hutton of the escalating situation. She shot the GPS, giving the coordinates of where the SEALs were located and where the Taliban waited to ambush them. She asked if Apache helos were available.<br><br>No.<br><br>An A-10 Warthog slumming in the area?<br><br>No.<br><br>A C-130 ghost ship?<br><br>No.<br><br>A damned B-52 on racetrack?<br><br>No. All flight assets were tied up with a major engagement to the east, near J-bad.<br><br>"What the hell <em>can</em> you give me, Dover?"<br><br>Khat was only a Marine Corps staff sergeant, and her handler, a navy commander, but she didn't give a damn at this point. Four good men were going to die on that scree slope really soon.<br><br>"No joy," Hutton ground back.<br><br>"You're going to lose four SEALs," she snapped back in a whisper, watching through her Nightforce scope. "Do you want another Operation Redwings?"<br><br>She knew that would sting him. Four brave SEALs had walked into a Taliban trap of two hundred. They were completely outmatched and without any type of support because their radio failed, and they couldn't call for backup help.<br><br>It had been one of the major reasons she'd gotten into her black ops activity and become involved. Khat didn't want any more fine men murdered because a drone wasn't available, or a satellite, or a friggin' Apache combat helicopter.<br><br>More men had died that night when a hastily assembled QRF, Quick Reaction Force, was finally strung together out of J-bad. The MH-47 Chinook had taken an RPG, rocket-propelled grenade, into it, and it had crashed, killing all sixteen on board. More lives were wasted. She had cried for days after it happened, unable to imagine the tragedy inflicted upon the families involved. None of their husbands, brothers or fathers were coming home.<br><br><em>It can't happen again.</em> She wouldn't allow it. Khat knew without a sat phone, radio calls into this area were DOA, dead on arrival. The radio call would never be heard. She wasn't sure the leader of the patrol had one on him.<br><br>"There are no assets available."<br><br>"You said this team is out of Camp Bravo?"<br><br>"Affirmative. I'm initiating a QRF from Bagram. But it will take an hour for them to arrive on scene."<br><br>"What about a QRF from Camp Bravo?" Khat wanted to scream at this guy to get off his ass and get involved. Sometimes she wondered why they'd given her Hutton. He was a very conservative black ops handler. She wished she still had Commander Timothy Skelling, but he'd just rotated Stateside. Hutton reminded her of a slug; as if he didn't know what to do quickly, when pressed.<br><br>"I'm calling them, too. They can be on scene, providing they aren't already engaged elsewhere, in thirty minutes."<br><br>"Roger," she said, her voice hardening. "Get a call patched through to that platoon and warn them." <em>Like fucking yesterday.</em> She felt her rage rising. It always did in situations like this. She didn't want to lose Americans.<br><br>"I've sent a call over to Chief Mac McCutcheon of Delta Platoon."<br><br>"I'm waiting five minutes," Khat growled. "If I don't see that team stop and hunker down for an incoming call from Bravo, I'm engaging. The least I can do is warn off the SEALs, and they'll take appropriate action."<br><br>Shifting her scope, she saw more of Khogani's men sneaking up on the other side of the ridge. There had to be twenty of the enemy in all. Smaller boys with the Taliban group held the reins of the horses far below the slope. Sweat ran down her temples, the heat at this time of day unbearable.<br><br>"Archangel, you are <em>not</em> authorized to engage. Repeat. Do not engage. Your duty is to observe only.<br><br>Over."<br><br>She cursed Hutton in her mind. "Roger, Dover Actual. Out." She hated Hutton's heavy, snarling voice. All they did was spar with one another. <em>To hell with him.</em><br><br>Khat wasn't about to take on thirty or so Taliban with one sniper rifle. But she could fire some shots before the muzzle fire from her rifle was seen by the Taliban. They would be fourteen-hundred-yard shots, and she set up to take out at least two or three of the hidden tangos. A .300 Win Mag didn't have a muzzle suppressor. Khat knew she could become instant toast when the sharp-eyed enemy spotted her location.<br><br>In the back of her mind as she checked elevation and windage, she knew Hutton would get a QRF up and pronto, if one was available. A quick reaction force would be needed because she knew Khogani's men would attack these four SEALs. Camp Bravo, a forward operating base, sat about thirty miles from the Af-Pak border, near where she was presently operating.<br><br>She knew SEALs carried the fight to the enemy, but sometimes it was wiser to back off and wait another day. Frustration thrummed through Khat.<br><br>Settling the rifle butt deeply into her right shoulder, her cheek pressed hard against the fiberglass stock, she placed one of the Taliban in the crosshairs. They were in a rocky stronghold waiting to spring the trap on the unsuspecting SEALs. Khat wished she could contact the team directly. She didn't have their radio code because it changed daily. And that's what she'd have to have in order to call that lead SEAL and warn him of the impending ambush.<br><br>The SEAL patrol members were all carrying heavily packed rucks and wearing Kevlar vests and helmets, which meant they were going to engage in a direct-action mission. Usually, she saw some patrols with SEALs wearing black baseball caps, or field hats, their radio mics near their mouths and carrying light kits, making swift progress toward some objective in the night.<br><br>Not this patrol. These guys were armed to the teeth. The lead SEAL's H-gear, a harness that held fifteen pockets worn around the man's chest and waist, held a maximum load of mags, magazines, of M-4 rifle ammo where he could easily reach it. These guys knew they were going into a firefight. But in broad daylight? Who authorized that kind of crazy mission? SEALs worked in the dark of night to avoid being seen by the enemy. It was rare they would be out on a daylight mission. What a FUBAR. Whoever put this op together was crazy.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, prone on her belly, she was glad she had on a Kevlar vest so she wouldn't have small stones biting deeply into the front of her chest. She had a 24X magnification on her Nightforce scope and could clearly see in the late-afternoon sunlight the man she'd chosen to kill. Glancing at her watch, she had two minutes before those five minutes were up. Hutton had better damn well have gotten his SEAL ass in gear.<br><br>The sun's slant was changing. Khat patiently watched her target. Every once in a while, she'd twist her head, glancing toward the SEALs slowly making their way up the steep slope. They blended in, but the Taliban had sharp eyes like her.<br><br><em>Two minutes.</em><br><br><em>Nothing from Hutton.</em><br><br>Nostrils flaring, Khat settled the scope on the nearest man holding an RPG casually over his shoulder. There were seven tangos in total who had RPGs. That was more than enough to kill these four SEALs. And they were a hundred feet of being in range of them. Slowing her breathing, she sighted, her finger brushing the two-pound trigger. Exhaling, she allowed her lungs to empty naturally. There was a one-second beat between inhale and exhale. The snipers referred to it as the still-point. And that is when she took the shot.<br><br>The booming sound of the .300 blasted through the silence. The jerk of the rifle rippled through her entire body. Khat instantly shot again. And a third time. She released the spent mag and slapped in another with the butt of her palm. All the Taliban targets went down. Jerking her rifle around, scope on the SEALs, she saw them instantly flatten out against the rocks. They were looking in <em>her</em> direction! <em>Damn it!</em><br><br>She didn't have to wait long. RPGs launched, even if out of range, toward the SEALs. Khat swung the scope toward the Taliban. A number of them were angrily pointing her way. Yeah, they had her location. But she was fourteen hundred yards out of range, and those SEALs were four hundred yards from the enemy. Were they going to send tangos after her or not? Her heart started a slow beat as she scoped the enemy.<br><br>There was confusion among their ranks. They were yelling at each other.<br><br>And then her blood iced. There was Sattar Kho-gani, the young punk of twenty-four years who'd just taken over his father's leadership as chief of the Hill Tribe. His father, Mustafa, had recently been killed by a SEAL sniper. She'd celebrated. Sattar was in the center of his commanders, too short to take a shot at.<br><br>There were a lot of arms and hands waving, and she could see his lieutenants yelling and pointing at the SEALs and some pointing in her direction. Who to go after? She was counting on that confusion among the enemy.<br><br>Smiling grimly, Khat settled down again, muzzle and sights on the Taliban. She heard the throaty answer of the SEALs M-4 rifles as they engaged, firing off careful shots at the Taliban hidden behind the walled, rocky fort.<br><br>Not waiting, she began to fire into the crowd of Taliban officers, picking them off. Her shoulder felt bruised after firing nine rounds, the buck of the Win Mag terrific. Below her, her hearing keyed on the SEALs, they continued to return fire, spread out in a diamond formation on the scree to protect their flanks.<br><br>The Taliban suddenly surged out of the fort, waving their AK-47s, firing wildly at the SEALs. The RPGs were launched.<br><br>Khat swung her rifle, sighting on the closest man, taking him out before he could lob an RPG into the SEAL team. Damn! There were too many for her to stop! Cursing softly, she heard the RPGs explode. The pressure waves reached her, but she was spared, hunkered down a hair beneath the ridgeline.<br><br>Khat couldn't look to see how the SEALs were doing. She was taking out the enemy systematically, one at a time. There were more than thirty of the enemy and it seemed more and more arrived, and they started realizing they were caught in a deadly crossfire.<br><br>Khat pulled out two more mags of three bullets each. She released the spent mag and slapped in the full mag, settling in, swiftly looking through her sites. She saw one man shoulder the RPG. She shot before he did. Sweat was rolling down her face, burning into her eyes, making her blink, her vision blurring momentarily. With a hiss, she remained focused, continuing to pick them off.<br><br>The Taliban grudgingly retreated.<br><br>Khat waited, taking a deep breath, watching them through the scope. Lifting her head, she checked down the slope at the SEALs. They were quickly retreating in diamond formation. Smart guys. <em>Get the hell outta Dodge because you are way outnumbered, guys...</em><br><br>Wiping her face with the back of her cammie sleeve, she quickly focused on the stone fort. More hand waving and shouting among the Taliban officers. The group had just lost half its men. More fists waved angrily in the air.<br><br>Sattar was still surrounded, and she couldn't draw a bead on him. <em>Damn.</em> She'd really like to take out the little bastard. Partial payment for what his sick monster father had done to so many innocent young boys and girls over his one-year reign as chief. He'd turned into a sex slave trader, and had so many young Afghan children kidnapped and sold across the border in Pakistan. She hated Mustafa, and she was sure his son was going to pick up where his sick sexual-predator father left off.<br><br>Mike Tarik ordered his men to retreat. He'd made calls to Camp Bravo, finding out the QRF was out on another run in the opposite direction from where they were located. There were no flight assets available. Worse, no drone or satellite was available over their area to understand the field of battle.<br><br>They were essentially blind in the fog of war, and engaging a much larger force than was anticipated. And they were caught out in the open on the scree with no place to hide.<br><br>Breathing hard, he kept watch over the other three men that he had responsibility for. Their comms man, Ernie, couldn't raise shit in this dead zone. The sat phone he had in his ruck had taken a bullet earlier. They were in a bad situation. The only thing they could do with the sun setting was retreat and then melt into the landscape of darkness and wait for pickup sometime later. They <em>had</em> to get off this scree ASAP.<br><br>Tarik heard a scream. Then more screams. He was playing rear guard to his men, higher on the slope than they were. Lifting his M-4, he saw at least fifteen Taliban charging them. Fuck!<br><br>He moved backward, slipped and fell among the rocks. Rolling, he managed to hang on to his rifle that was clipped to a harness across his shoulder and chest. He stopped his slide at the edge of the ridge, a hundred-foot drop into a wadi, or ravine, below.<br><br>Sighting, he began to slow fire, choosing his targets, remaining crouched. Again, he heard the booming sound of a Win Mag far above him. Who the hell was that? He wasn't aware of any SEAL sniper assets in the area. Who, then? Whoever was firing was helping his team out a helluva lot. The sniper was giving them a chance to retreat.<br><br>Tarik heard the dreaded hollow <em>thunk</em> of an RPG being fired. He jerked a look up and saw the damn thing sailing lazily through the air&#x2014;right at him. Cursing, he dived to the ground, the rocks biting and bruising him. He automatically put his hands behind his head, buried his face in the rocks, opened his mouth and waited. If he didn't open his mouth, the blast pressure waves would make Jell-O out of his lungs, the air in his chest not equalizing with the air surrounding him.<br><br>The blast went off. The last thing he remembered was flying through the air.</p><h2>Handbook of Plant Forms for Botanical Artists</h2><p>Ernest E.

She&#x2019;d been the town&#x2019;s librarian from the time I&#x2019;d first moved to our town, fond of greeting me with lines such as &#x201c;What will it be, Jessica&#x2014;more books on poisons?&#x201d; She retired a few years ago when her multiple sclerosis finally grew too bad for her to continue negotiating the stacks.</p><p>In lieu of a eulogy, Jean had penned brief snippets directed at any number of town staples. I thought mine would take the cake, until Sheriff Mort Metzger&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201c;Well, Mort, I guess I&#x2019;m going to get away with not paying those parking tickets, after all&#x201d;&#x2014;got a louder laugh.</p><p>Meanwhile, the snippet for Seth Hazlitt, Cabot Cove&#x2019;s resident family doctor, raised merely a collective giggle:</p><p>&#x201c;I think you can cancel my next appointment, Seth.&#x201d; But then &#x201c;Sorry, but I don&#x2019;t have a forwarding address to send my bill&#x201d; got a louder reception.</p><p>I hate funerals, but then again, I don&#x2019;t know anyone who likes them. Jean&#x2019;s was different in the sense that she&#x2019;d beaten the odds at every turn: first by outlasting the dreaded disease&#x2019;s debilitating effects and then by drastically outliving her expected life span. She&#x2019;d even enjoyed a final renaissance of sorts, thanks to an experimental new treatment provided by the Clifton Clinic, aka Clifton Care Partners, a state-of-the-art private hospital that had opened just outside town and was about to celebrate its first anniversary. Billed as a &#x201c;rejuvenation&#x201d; clinic as well as a hospital, the Clifton Clinic had drawn a steady flow of outsiders to our once bucolic town year-round, further roiling those of us who remembered what it had been like when we could greet everyone in Cabot Cove by name.</p><p>I learned a long time ago that you can&#x2019;t fight change; even the beloved home I&#x2019;d shared with my late husband, Frank, was undergoing extensive renovations in the wake of a fire that had nearly claimed my life.

Frank and I practically raised our nephew Grady, which meant he grew up witnessing my fits and starts of writing back in my days substitute teaching high school English. It had been Grady who&#x2019;d plucked my first manuscript, The Corpse Danced at Midnight, almost literally from the trash and given it to his girlfriend at the time, who happened to work for Coventry House, the imprint that would ultimately become my first publishing house.</p><p>And if it weren&#x2019;t for him, I&#x2019;d probably still be filling in for others instead of filling in the plot holes I inevitably found through my rewrite process.</p><p>Listening to the priest wax on with more of Jean O&#x2019;Neil&#x2019;s testimonials left me feeling I should invite Grady and his family up for a visit soon. It had been too long since I&#x2019;d seen them, especially young Frank, named after my husband, and more like a grandson to me, given that his namesake and I had raised his father through a great measure of Grady&#x2019;s youth. And he so enjoyed blaming some of the business scrapes he&#x2019;d gotten himself into over the years pursuing this scheme or that one on having a fertile imagination to match mine.</p><p>Thinking of Grady and his family also made me realize it had been too long since I&#x2019;d spoken with George Sutherland, the Scotland Yard inspector who was the only man I&#x2019;d ever actually dated since Frank&#x2019;s death, though I&#x2019;m not sure our get-togethers were dates so much as two friends enjoying some mutual interests and each other&#x2019;s company.</p><p>In other words, dates.</p><p>Since Jean had no family, the Friends of the Library had taken on the task of arranging her service and funeral arrangements, and passed on a wake or memorial in favor of a reception to follow her burial in Cabot Cove&#x2019;s local cemetery, which was part of the National Historic Register. As chair of the Friends, I had the official greeting responsibilities, which I was dutifully performing outside the church when I spotted Mimi Van Dorn approaching.</p><p>&#x201c;Wonderful service, Jessica,&#x201d; she said, taking my hand affectionately. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it would&#x2019;ve made Jean proud.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Mimi. I sure do miss her.&#x201d;</p><p>Mimi looked around the front of our old church, shaking the platinum blond hair from her face. Once her natural color, it now came courtesy of a bottle. Mimi was several years older than I, but you wouldn&#x2019;t know that from her appearance. She joined the Friends of the Library as soon as she moved to Cabot Cove nearly a decade ago, and we quickly bonded over our mutual love of books. Not just reading, but the need to support the printed page and, especially, libraries. I recall a particularly contentious town council meeting in which we needed to beat back a proposal to relocate our beloved library to make room for yet another high-end housing development. But Mimi launched into an impassioned speech that left those council members flirting with voting for the proposal abruptly changing their minds.</p><p>&#x201c;I leave you with this, ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; Mimi had concluded, turning to face the standing-room-only crowd. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t just a choice between books and buildings, wood and words; it&#x2019;s also a choice between dreams and development.</p><p>Mimi won me there and we&#x2019;d been close ever since. She was one of my closest friends in town, having taught me how to play bridge, canasta, and pinochle, though gin rummy remained my favorite. She had come from old money and had settled in Cabot Cove long before it became fashionable to do so. We seldom, if ever, talked about our personal lives, but rather our favorite books over the years. We rarely agreed, which seemed to draw us even closer. I&#x2019;ve bonded with people over many things through the years, but never over anything as effectively as books.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I intend to make a sizable donation to the library in Jean&#x2019;s name,&#x201d; Mimi said. &#x201c;Perhaps to name a new collection. What was her favorite genre?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anything but mystery,&#x201d; I told her.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m being serious here, Jessica.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So am I. She was a fan of classical fiction and looked forward to the day, she used to say, when I finally wrote a real book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re joking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe, but only in part. She used to read my books only to offer me critiques of what she deemed the more relevant parts, all of three or four pages, normally. She did that for all forty-seven of my books, and I&#x2019;ll miss her doing it when number forty-eight comes out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A clever way of letting you know she&#x2019;d read them.&#x201d; Mimi nodded, dabbing her eyes with a folded-over handkerchief, more to keep her makeup in place than out of grief.</p><p>Mimi hadn&#x2019;t seemed to have aged in the years I&#x2019;d known her; if anything, she looked younger. I knew how vain she was about her appearance, just as I knew how loath she was to the surgical methods to which many women resorted. She&#x2019;d become a health fiend in recent years and an obsessive follower of new diets meant to assure eternal youth. We&#x2019;d first met when she caught me jogging along the sea and then again when I was riding my bicycle through town. She&#x2019;d thought I&#x2019;d eschewed driving to get more exercise until I confessed it was because I never learned how to drive.</p><p>&#x201c;But I heard you had your pilot&#x2019;s license,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d remarked.</p><p>&#x201c;I do, thanks to my late husband, Frank, who taught me how to fly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But not drive? Really?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not a lot of accidents up in the air, Ms. Van Dorn,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said.</p><p>&#x201c;So long as you don&#x2019;t run out of fuel,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d quipped. &#x201c;And call me Mimi.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you at the reception, then,&#x201d; Mimi resumed today, angling away from me to cross the street toward her car, parked away from the funeral procession.</p><p>Most of the rest of the crowd had moved toward the parking lot that adjoined the church. I saw Mimi reach the street and noticed she&#x2019;d dropped her handkerchief on the grassy strip we&#x2019;d been standing on. I stooped to retrieve it, rising to see her pause in the middle of the road, speaking heatedly into her cell phone&#x2014;as an SUV, an old Jeep Cherokee, suddenly wheeled around the corner, picking up speed, headed directly at Mimi.</p><p>I lurched into motion, charging into the street and practically leaping into Mimi just before the Jeep would have struck her, the two of us locked in an uneasy embrace as we spun to the other side of the road and squeezed between two parked cars.</p><p>&#x201c;Jessica,&#x201d; a white-faced Mimi managed to utter, stiff and pale with shock.</p><p>&#x201c;One funeral for the day is enough,&#x201d; I said, forcing a smile even though I was shaking like a leaf.</p><p>I walked off toward the car belonging to the Friends of the Library member who&#x2019;d be driving me to the reception to get things prepared. Cocking my gaze backward to make sure Mimi was okay, I spotted her back on her phone, yelling at whoever was on the other end of the line. Then I peered down the street, as if expecting the old Jeep Cherokee to come roaring back.</p><p>But it had disappeared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The Cabot Cove Friends of the Library thought it fitting to host a reception at the library after Jean&#x2019;s funeral. Her replacement, the great Doris Ann, had missed the ceremony in order to supervise the catering team&#x2019;s setup and to make sure they didn&#x2019;t damage any of the books in the process. Doris Ann didn&#x2019;t greet me with the likes of &#x201c;What will it be, Jessica&#x2014;more books on poisons?&#x201d; but she was always there to guide my research efforts, whether they be by traditional page or Internet site. Doris Ann had brought our little library into the twenty-first century, making it more popular, and relevant, than ever, and she&#x2019;d jumped at the chance to organize the reception to honor her predecessor as Cabot Cove librarian.</p><p>Still shaken by Mimi&#x2019;s nearly being struck by that Jeep, I ducked away from the funeral cortege and skipped the grave-site portion in order to help Doris Ann and to act as official greeter for arriving guests on behalf of the Friends. I&#x2019;d been going to more and more funerals as I grew older&#x2014;expected for sure, but no easier to stomach. When the number reached as many real-life murders as I&#x2019;d solved, maybe I should take that as a sign to move somewhere where nobody was older than thirty.</p><p>Our little library dated back to the time when Cabot Cove had been no more than a fishing village, offering entertaining respite to wives while their husbands were at sea for weeks at a time. I can picture any number of them devouring Hawthorne and Melville, though I suspect Moby-Dick never ranked among their favorites. Losing themselves in this book or that by candlelight would&#x2019;ve made for the ideal distraction from the long nights spent alone fretting over the fate of their husbands, while their children slept soundly. I like to think that the many readers of J. B. Fletcher come to my mysteries for a similarly entertaining distraction, and I revel more than anything in those who profess to have lost themselves in my books, for a short time anyway.</p><p>In addition to the classics, Jean O&#x2019;Neil&#x2019;s tastes in fiction seemed to run to more exotic, far-flung adventures, as she used her reading as a travelogue to visit places her deteriorating body prevented her from ever seeing in person. I recall she had a special fascination with Tahiti, but I never learned precisely why.</p><p>And now I never would. As Doris Ann and I supervised the efforts of Cabot Cove Catering in repurposing our local world of books, I tried not to fixate on the finality that came with funerals and the increasing number of them I&#x2019;d been attending. I resolved again to reach out to Grady to schedule a visit.</p><p>The first guests started streaming in the very moment the setup was complete. Most seemed to bypass the cold cuts and salads for the dessert table, accompanied by old-fashioned urns of the coffee that Cabot Cove Catering was known for. Dr. Seth Hazlitt, Cabot Cove&#x2019;s own resident physician, was grousing in a corner with cup in hand, looking warm and uncomfortable in a dark tweed suit that made for a stark contrast with the white or khaki linen garb that had long been his trademark around town.</p><p>&#x201c;Hiding, Seth?&#x201d; I said, tossing a smile his way.</p><p>&#x201c;If I wanted to hide in a library, Jess, I&#x2019;d take up post in the science section, since nobody reads science anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There are far too many who don&#x2019;t read anything at all these days.&#x201d;</p><p>He toasted me with his cup. &#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s a good thing for you that there are enough that still do, ayuh.&#x201d; Seth hesitated, his entire demeanor seeming to stiffen. &#x201c;She fired me, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who fired you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jean O&#x2019;Neil. I&#x2019;d been treating her MS for years, even consulted with experts down at the Brigham in Boston for the latest treatments and protocols. Then she fired me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know a patient could fire a doctor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, replaced. With that clinic the zoning board approved for some ungodly reason.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Technically, the Clifton Clinic is a private hospital, Seth, and they didn&#x2019;t need anyone&#x2019;s permission in Cabot Cove because they set up shop outside our boundaries.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still claim a Cabot Cove address, though, don&#x2019;t they, Jess?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like I said&#x2014;technically.&#x201d;</p><p>Seth took another sip of his coffee. &#x201c;I think they killed her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Multiple sclerosis killed Jean. She credited them with buying her another year, thanks to that clinical trial.&#x201d;</p><p>Seth&#x2019;s expression was hovering somewhere between a snicker and a snarl. &#x201c;A clinical trial Brigham and Women&#x2019;s Hospital knew nothing about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a big world out there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not in medicine, it&#x2019;s not. I may be an old country doctor, but I&#x2019;ve been working the Internet since I delivered the Mercer twins back in 1996, and I can&#x2019;t find anything about this experimental protocol anywhere.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It bought Jean another nine decent months, Seth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which I couldn&#x2019;t buy her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that,&#x201d; I said, the loudening hum of voices in my ear telling me the lobby was starting to fill up.</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to,&#x201d; Seth Hazlitt said, in a tone I&#x2019;d never quite heard him use before. &#x201c;Jean did when she fired me. Go on now, Jess. Leave an old man to his misery and continue with your hosting duties.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;d rather talk to you.&#x201d;</p><p>He drained the rest of his coffee. &#x201c;I need a refill,&#x201d; he said, and walked off.</p><p>No sooner had Seth Hazlitt taken his leave than Mimi Van Dorn appeared in almost the very spot he&#x2019;d occupied, looking none the worse for wear after nearly being struck by that Jeep Cherokee.</p><p>&#x201c;You certainly know how to throw a bash, Jessica,&#x201d; she said, as the many residents of Cabot Cove continued to stream in to pay their respects.</p><p>&#x201c;I think the credit for that belongs to Jean.&#x201d;</p><p>I reached out and brushed some stray crumbs from the jacket of Mimi&#x2019;s designer suit. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t want anything to make you less becoming, especially while wearing black.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes scorned me. &#x201c;Such a keen eye for observation, and yet the suit is charcoal gray.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So it is,&#x201d; I said, still not able to tell the difference.</p><p>&#x201c;And if it hadn&#x2019;t been you, it would be stained with red right now and plenty of it. And I&#x2019;d be somewhere else entirely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wh...</p></p><h2>Western African History (Selected Course Outlines and Reading Lists from American Col)</h2><p>This volume covers five hundred years of history, beginning with the writings of travelers Ibn Battuta, Leo Africanus, Mungo Park, Heinrich Barth, Ren� Caill�, and Mary Kingsley, as well as many others.

During his journey Flute encounters many perils, including natural predators and devastating habitat loss. &#x201c;Cherry has a gift for sharing her knowledge through engaging fictional stories.&#x201d;--<i>Booklist</i><br></p><p>LYNNE CHERRY has devoted her life to sharing her concern about environmental issues with others. Her important children&#39;s books also include The Armadillo from Amarillo and two tales from the Amazon rain forest: The Great Kapok Tree and The Shaman&#39;s Apprentice. She lives in Washington, D.C.Kindergarten-Grade 3. Cherry takes readers through the first year of a wood thrush's life, from its hatching in a forest in Maryland to its migration across the Gulf of Mexico to the Costa Rican rain forest and back again. Two children, who observe the bird as a young chick and juvenile, name him Flute "for they knew that when he grew up he would sing as beautifully as his father and that his song would echo through the forest." The same children wait for Flute's return the following spring and watch as he and his mate, whom they name Feather, build a nest and raise their young. In the course of Flute's travels, he encounters a hawk, insects tainted with pesticide, a prowling cat, and a shrinking habitat. The eggs and nestlings are even more at risk. Naming the birds effectively keeps the focus on their individual story, and the author is careful not to anthropomorphize. At the same time, perhaps because of this, the narrative comes off as a laundry list of the perils facing migratory songbirds and keeps readers at a distance. The lustrous watercolors, particularly the paintings of Flute alone, are exceptionally well rendered. Some of the larger scenes, however, are so chock-full of flora and fauna that they seem unnatural; with the exception of the shape of the leaves, the northern forest seems to be as dense and rich with wildlife as the rain forest. An author's note and resplendent map endpapers round out this earnest and informative presentation. Luann Toth, School Library Journal (<i>School Library Journal</i> )<br><br>Ages 5-8. Cherry has a gift for sharing her knowledge through engaging fictional stories. Here, through the tale of a young wood thrush, readers learn the dangers migratory birds face. Cherry's illustrations, always a feast for the eyes, provide colorful, richly detailed forest scenes as a handsome backdrop for the story of Flute's autumn migration from his birthplace in a Maryland forest to a Central American rain forest. There he rests and feeds before beginning his journey back north in the spring. Along the way, Flute faces natural predators, but the destruction of habitat is presented as the most serious threat. A concluding author's note makes the point more directly and offers some concrete suggestions for youngsters who want to help. A nice addition to Cherry's impressive body of environmental literature for children.

The season had begun. Debutantes and chaperones were planning their luncheons, teas, dinners, balls. And the blackmailer was planning his strategies, stalking his next victim. But Chief Detective Inspector Roderick Alleyn knew that something was up. He had already planted his friend Lord Robert Gospell at the scene. But someone else got there first...</p><p>From her first book in 1934 to her final volume just before her death in 1982, <b>Ngaio Marsh</b>'s work has remained legendary, and is often compared to that of Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. During her celebrated fifty-year career, Marsh was made a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, was named Dame Commander, Order of the British Empire, won numerous prestigious awards, and penned 32 mystery novels.<br><br>Now St. Martin's Dead Letter Mysteries is thrilled to make all of Marsh's novels available again for old fans to relish and new ones to discover. So sit back, draw the curtains, lock the doors, and put yourself in the hands of Grande Dame of detective novels...<br>Lauded as &#34;the best detective story ever&#34; by Dashiell Hammett, Marsh&#39;s vintage whodunit grabs the listener at once with a group of debutantes and a tragic murder. Elegance mixes with blackmail as Chief Detective Inspector Roderick Alleyn pairs up with artist/paramour Agatha Troy to investigate. Narrator Peter Wickham is particularly strong in his delivery of women&#39;s voices as well as the peculiarly high-pitched vocalizations of Lord &#34;Bunchy&#34; Gospell. The spoiled society youth are made more engaging by Wickham&#39;s charm. Wickham delivers upper-class British accents and intonations to vividly bring to mind the glamorous 1930s era. As the blackmailer piles up victims, this classic mystery continues to thrive with Marsh&#39;s clever wit and timeless plot construction.

Gardeners with shallow soils over chalk have to deal with the additional problem of excessively free drainage. With this second type of soil many of the plants so beguilingly described as 'revelling in lime' would, in fact, be inappropriate choices; these plants enjoy the fertility of an alkaline soil, but not all of them appreciate the dryness of one through which moisture passes extremely quickly. </p><p> The plants in the following list do well, rather than survive, in both the alkalinity and the rather dry conditions of shallow soils over chalk. (Occasionally, acid soil may overlie chalk but this combination is a relatively rare one.) For areas, within a chalky garden, which are particularly dry and hot, the list entitled 'Plants suitable for dry soils in bot, sunny sites' should be consulted. Almost all the plants which appear in that list do well in alkaline soils, but there are exceptions: hybrids and varieties of the common broom, <i>Cytisus scoparius,</i> and <i>Berberis thunbergii</i> and its varieties do best in a neutral soil (that is, one which is neither alkaline nor acid), as do <i>Ulex europaeus</i> 'Plenus', a form of gorse with double flowers, and <i>Liriope muscari.</i> </p><p> Many apparently obvious candidates for inclusion do not appear in this list. Some of these plants have been excluded because they become diseased on dry soils: for instance, without constant moisture Michaelmas daisies are, in general, prone to mildew (the exception to this rule, <i>Aster x frikartii,</i> has been included as a suitable plant). Another group of favourite plants for alkaline soils are the clematis but, particularly in the case of the large-flowered hybrids, they require moisture and a good depth of soil to succeed; even the vigorous <i>Clematis montana</i> and its varieties do best in a <i>moist,</i> well-drained soil. Some plants, like annual sweet peas, the larger antirrhinums or snapdragons, and the so-called florists' chrysanthemums, rather than the border varieties of the genus, are grown almost exclusively for large blooms; these will only be produced on soils which have plenty of moisture-retentive nourishment dug into them. </p><p> Occasionally, some members of a mostly unsuitable genus sound as if they might do well in chalk soils: in general, lilies, for example, prefer or need acid soils, but <i>Lilium candidum,</i> the madonna lily, does best in an alkaline soil. However, no lily of any sort must be allowed to dry out and, since this can be difficult to ensure on shallow soils over chalk, <i>Lilium candidum</i> is, in fact, as unsuitable as all other members of the genus tor inclusion in the present list. </p><p> There are also some plants which, most discouragingly, show their dislike of a shallow, chalk soil only some considerable time after they have been planted there. On dry, chalky soils, the various japonicas and flowering quinces often produce yellow leaves after having looked healthy when younger; and, after a few years on a shallow soil, the fast-growing Leyland cypress may become top heavy and <i>Calocedrus decurrens</i> begin to lose foliage from its upper branches. </p><p> Although the fertility of alkaline soil means that even gardeners contending with chalk have a large number of suitable plants to choose from, the range of plants with certain features is rather restricted. And, of course, there are the forbidden fruits of rhododendrons, camellias and most related plants. Indeed, the main problem for many gardeners who live in areas of shallow soil over chalk is not the high alkalinity or quick drainage of their soil, but their inability to overcome a longing tor, say, rhododendrons or heathers. </p><p> This longing can most easily be satisfied by growing otherwise prohibited plants in tubs, or similar containers, filled with some lime-free growing medium (sec list entitled 'Trees, shrubs and climbers suitable for growing in containers' lot a number of suggestions). Alternatively, certain small, manageable areas of the garden can have the alkalinity of the soil reduced and its moisture-retentiveness improved by the addition of peat and leaf-mould. In these areas the lime-tolerant, winter-flowering heaths or heathers and so on can be planted (for suitable plants see entries <i>not</i> marked with an asterisk in the 'Acid soils' list). The construction of anything other than the smallest of peat beds or walls is a more elaborate and ambitious project which only the enthusiast should attempt. </p><p> Finally, it is worth remembering that many plants associated with woodlands and acid, leaf-mouldy soils are not, in fact, adverse to alkaline conditions. The most important requirement of plants like hostas and astilbes, for example, is not acidity but moisture. By incorporating plenty of moisture-retaining substances such as garden compost, leaf-mould and peat, a range of plants even wider than the sizeable one given here can be grown in shallow soils over chalk. </p><p> Copyright � 1984 by Nicola Ferguson</p></p><h2>Across the Plains in the Donner Party</h2><p>The memoirs of a teenage survivor of the ill-fated Donner Party, which was trapped in the snows of the Sierra Nevada mountains 150 years ago</p><p>George Rippey Stewart (May 31, 1895 August 22, 1980) was an American toponymist, a novelist, and a professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley. He is best known for his only science fiction novel Earth Abides (1949), a post-apocalyptic novel, for which he won the first International Fantasy Award in 1951. It was dramatized on radio&#39;s Escape and inspired Stephen King&#39;s The Stand.Grade 6 Up?This noteworthy recounting of the Donner party and its gruesome end should be a sure success. Zeinert presents, along with introductory material and editorial commentary, the edited memoirs of survivor Virginia Reed Murphy, age 12 during the trip; the letters and diary of Virginia's stepfather; as well as excerpts from the journal of Patrick Breen, who faithfully recorded all of the horrific events that befell the Donners and their fellow emigrants. It is fascinating to compare the different accounts; Virginia does not mention any cannibalism, but nevertheless gives a realistic picture with a minimum of flowery 19th-century prose, written 45 years after the event. James Reed's early letters to the newspaper back home exhibit a macho brashness and confidence, while his later diary entries reveal underlying emotions of anguish and fear. Zeinert explains what encouraged the Donner and Reed families to undertake this arduous overland journey cross country in the spring of 1846. Primary sources and additions by Zeinert also show why the party became stranded and the foolishness of some of its decisions. In later life Virginia's advice to friends in Illinois was, "Bring nothing but provisions and just enough clothing to last until you get here, and don't take any cutoffs." Chronologies, maps, and reproductions of historical photographs accompany a bibliography of sources and a list of books for further reading.?David A.

He lives with his family in Southern California. <i>Doing Harm</i> is his first novel.</p>CHAPTER 1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>Saturday, July 11</i> <br>&#x201c;Steve?&#x201d; Sally&#x2019;s voice floats down from our bedroom at the top of the stairs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m almost ready. Are the girls okay?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re fine,&#x201d; I call back automatically, staring into the downstairs bathroom mirror. I give one final tug on my tie, walk out of the bathroom, and step over the baby gate that guards the living-room entrance, separating that space from the rest of our small house like a barbed-wire fence around a POW camp. I survey the scene. <br>Katie is hunched over her play stove in a corner of the room, rummaging through plastic pots and pans and muttering to herself. Her five-year-old face is set in fierce concentration, and I glimpse what family and friends often comment on but that I myself rarely acknowledge out loud: Except for her dark black hair, which today is set in pigtails, Katie is the spitting image of me&#x2014;green eyes, an elongated face, and prominent ears. Meanwhile, a short distance away, Annabelle observes Katie serenely from her baby walker, thinking about whatever it is that ten-month-olds think about. She looks every bit as much like her mother as Katie looks like me, with straight, dark black hair, matching dark eyes, and a small nose. <br>Annabelle spots me, smiles adoringly, bangs happily on the narrow plastic shelf in front of her, bounces up and down, and waves like she hasn&#x2019;t seen me in months. I wave back like an idiot, pumping my hand back and forth with childish enthusiasm. The waving thing never gets old at this age, and I love it. &#x201c;Hi, &#x2019;Bella. Hi, sweetie.&#x201d; <br>Katie spins around. &#x201c;Daddy!&#x201d; she shrieks, running over and wrapping herself around my leg. I love that, too. Who wouldn&#x2019;t? Sure, they&#x2019;re a pain in the ass sometimes&#x2014;okay, practically <i>all</i> of the time&#x2014;but I can&#x2019;t imagine why anyone would not want to have kids. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m making dinner!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, boy. Show me.&#x201d; <br>She disengages herself from my leg, takes me by the hand, and leads me to the play stove. She solemnly spoons some white Styrofoam peanuts, the kind used as packing material in shipping boxes, from a plastic pot and into a small bowl, which she then hands to me. I poke its contents suspiciously and hold up one of the thumb-sized peanuts. <br>&#x201c;Where did these come from?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Mommy&#x2019;s box.&#x201d; She gestures toward an open cardboard box sitting near the front door, a recent purchase from an online store. A few of the peanuts lie scattered on the floor around it, carelessly strewn across the cracked linoleum. &#x201c;Eat, Daddy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Katie, you shouldn&#x2019;t be playing with these. They&#x2019;re too small for Annabelle.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But &#x2019;Bella likes them.&#x201d; <br>My stomach does a queasy flip. &#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;&#x2019;Bella likes them&#x2019;?&#x201d; I turn sharply to face Annabelle, realizing that she hasn&#x2019;t made a single sound, not so much as a gurgle or a raspberry, since I came into the room, and that her cheeks are puffed out, like a chipmunk with a bunch of nuts tucked in its mouth. She smiles at me again, and her lips part slightly, revealing a glimpse of white Styrofoam. <br>Annabelle bears my frantic plucking of all of the peanuts&#x2014;and there are <i>a lot</i> of them&#x2014;from her mouth with grace and equanimity, never once crying or resisting. When I&#x2019;m done, I hand her a plastic rattle, which she shoves in her mouth as if nothing happened, and squat down next to Katie, who&#x2019;s flipping calmly through a picture book. <br>&#x201c;Katie. You shouldn&#x2019;t have put those things in &#x2018;Bella&#x2019;s mouth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because they could have hurt her.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; A hint of defiance has crept into her voice. <br>&#x201c;She could have swallowed them and gotten sick.&#x201d; <br>Her lower jaw juts forward. &#x201c;&#x2019;Bella&#x2019;s not sick. She <i>liked</i> my dinner.&#x201d; <br> <i>Hard to argue with that.</i> I&#x2019;m trying to frame a suitable but firm response that doesn&#x2019;t involve complex descriptions of human-respiratory-tract anatomy when the doorbell rings. I check my watch. Right on time. As usual. &#x201c;Just&nbsp;&#x2026; don&#x2019;t do it again, Katie,&#x201d; I say lamely, rising to my feet. <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s already flipping pages in her picture book. <br>I grab the box full of the Styrofoam peanuts, shove it in a nearby closet, and open the front door to find my mother-in-law staring up at me, steely-eyed and unsmiling. <br>&#x201c;Hi, Mrs. Kim.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Steven.&#x201d; She steps across the threshold. I hesitate, and then awkwardly bend over to hug her. She wraps her arms around my waist and lightly pats my back once before quickly withdrawing. She steps back and stares at me coldly. <br>I shift my weight and cough. &#x201c;I, um&nbsp;&#x2026; We really appreciate you watching Katie and Annabelle tonight for us, Mrs. Kim.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome, Steven.&#x201d; <br>Like a knee-high rocket, Katie launches herself at my mother-in-law, grabbing her by the leg and screaming with laughter. Annabelle beams and bounces furiously up and down in her walker. <br>Mrs. Kim&#x2019;s face blossoms into a broad smile. &#x201c;Oh my goodness! What a wonderful greeting!&#x201d; With Katie still affixed to her leg, she gingerly steps into the room and, with a strength that defies her petite frame, scoops up Katie in one arm and Annabelle in the other. They giggle happily as she whispers to them in rapid-fire Korean. <br>Sally appears at the bottom of the stairs, her slim figure tucked into a sleek black cocktail dress, looking harried but elegant as she snaps a pearl earring into place. &#x201c;Hi, Mom. Thanks for coming over.&#x201d; She pecks her mother on the cheek, and they confer briefly on bath, dinner, and bed for the girls. &#x201c;We should be back by ten.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Where are you going tonight?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to a cocktail party for Steve&#x2019;s work before grabbing some dinner.&#x201d; <br>Her mother nods approvingly. &#x201c;Good. You deserve a night out.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m standing right there, but Mrs. Kim addresses Sally as if they&#x2019;re the only two people in the room. <br>&#x201c; <i>Good-bye,</i> Mom.&#x201d; We hug and kiss Katie and Annabelle good night, and a short while later we&#x2019;re in our sky blue Toyota Sienna minivan headed for my boss&#x2019;s house. <br>&#x201c;I think your mom is really starting to warm up to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Sally flips down the passenger-side sun visor and starts applying lipstick in the cosmetic mirror fixed to the back of it. <br>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t mention my weight.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Or my hairline.&#x201d; <br>Sally sighs. &#x201c;Why are you letting her get to you tonight?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d; <i>Yes I am.</i> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;&#x2026; I&#x2019;m a doctor. Aren&#x2019;t mothers-in-law supposed to, you know, appreciate the doctor thing?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She does. It partly makes up for your not being Korean.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s done with the lipstick and is fluffing her black, shoulder-length hair. <br>I glance at her, chagrined. Such blunt, casual acknowledgment of the only ongoing source of tension in our marriage&#x2014;her parents&#x2019; displeasure with their daughter&#x2019;s decision to marry outside the Korean community, a displeasure that two well-adjusted grandchildren and years of stable marriage have done little to diminish&#x2014;is unusual. <br>&#x201c;But not completely.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. And never will.&#x201d; She snaps the visor back into place and gazes out the window. &#x201c;But I think you know that already. Can we talk about something else?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; She must be in a philosophical mood or something. As bad as it&#x2019;s been for me with her parents, it&#x2019;s been ten times worse for her. But she&#x2019;s always stood her ground with them. It&#x2019;s one of the reasons I love her so much. <br>Sally is many different things, most of them synonyms for success, and all of which I absolutely adore: smart, driven, witty, confident. I know most people wouldn&#x2019;t call hers a pretty face&#x2014;on some objective level, from a purely aesthetic standpoint, I know it&#x2019;s quite plain, really; maybe even erring on the side of unattractive. Thick lips. A nose that&#x2019;s too small for her broad cheeks and wide-set eyes. But I can honestly say without a trace of sentimentality that I think she&#x2019;s absolutely beautiful. She has an indefinable charisma that belies her looks, an enviable, innate ability to walk into a crowded room, instinctually size it up, and win over every single person in it with smooth-talking charm. She doesn&#x2019;t even have to try. People like her. All kinds of people. To me, it&#x2019;s a mystical talent, something I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do if my life depended on it. And a talent that she&#x2019;s always put to good use: Before she had Katie and decided to stop working, Sally had a very successful career as a high-ranking assistant to the head of Human Resources at my hospital. That&#x2019;s how we met. <br>I try to think of something else to talk about, and my mind drifts back to the Styrofoam-peanut incident with Annabelle. I relate the story, playing down the part about me actually being out of the room when Katie shoved the packing material into her sister&#x2019;s mouth&#x2014;like a mother bear defending her cubs, Sally can be extremely touchy about anything that even remotely threatens the health of the girls, and my relatively more laissez-faire approach to parenting has gotten me into trouble with her more than once. But when I&#x2019;m finished, Sally simply throws back her head and laughs. &#x201c;&#x2018; <i>She liked my dinner.</i>&#x2019; You know, Katie reminds me more and more of you every day.&#x201d; <br>I think about the way Katie looked earlier tonight, bent over that stupid toy kitchen, so intent on what she was doing. &#x201c;Because she&#x2019;s so smart?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nice try. No. Because she&#x2019;s so stubborn.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; I grip the steering wheel a bit more firmly. <br>Sally pats my shoulder affectionately. &#x201c;I know. You hate hearing that. But it is what it is. Besides, it&#x2019;s not all bad. Being single-minded is what&#x2019;s enabled you to succeed. I mean, you <i>never</i> give up. I love that about you. But it is a <i>real</i> pain in the ass sometimes. Once you&#x2019;ve made up your mind about something, no force on the planet will get you to change it. Even when you&#x2019;re wrong. <i>Especially</i> when you&#x2019;re wrong. You know what I&#x2019;m talking about.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re seeing the same thing with Katie?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Every single day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Surgeons are pretty stubborn. Maybe she&#x2019;ll become a surgeon someday.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;God, I hope not.&#x201d; She smirks. <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Well&nbsp;&#x2026; you know what they say about surgeons, right?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Sometimes wrong, never unsure.</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Shit. Have I used that line before?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just a couple of hundred times. Where did you first hear it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not exactly certain. Probably from Collier.&#x201d; <br>We ride together in silence for a few minutes before she says, &#x201c;Your meeting with Dr. Collier is next Monday. Right?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What are the chances he&#x2019;s going to offer you a job?&#x201d; <br>My insides suddenly bunch up into a little ball. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Still? Haven&#x2019;t you talked to him about it yet?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We <i>really</i> need to stay here in Boston, Steve. Our whole lives are here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What do you want me to say?&#x201d; We&#x2019;re launching into a variation of a conversation we&#x2019;ve had countless times before. I <i>know</i> how much she wants to stay in Boston. &#x201c;The opportunity hasn&#x2019;t come up to talk about it. Besides, I think Northwest Hospital is getting ready to make a firm offer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But&nbsp;&#x2026; you don&#x2019;t want to work at Northwest.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The money&#x2019;s good at Northwest.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I said. It&#x2019;s not a medical school. It&#x2019;s not what you want.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How about Harvard, or U Mass?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not hiring right now.&#x201d; What&#x2019;s left unsaid is that there&#x2019;s only one job I really want anyway, more than I&#x2019;ve wanted just about anything else in my life, and Sally knows it: to work at University Hospital and be a professor at University Medical School. <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you ask Dr. Collier about it tonight? He&#x2019;ll be relaxed. Sociable.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m&nbsp;&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Since when are you so indecisive? You just got through saying how&#x201d;&#x2014;she lowers the pitch of her voice an octave&#x2014;&#x201c; <i>never unsure</i> you are.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t just go waltzing up to my boss and ask him for a job. It&#x2019;s not the way it works. We&#x2019;re talking about <i>University Hospital.</i> You don&#x2019;t <i>ask</i> to work at University. You&#x2019;re <i>invited.</i> Between med school and residency, I&#x2019;ve spent the last nine years of my life busting my ass there&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All the more reason for you to be proactive about the whole thing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t want to blow it now.&#x201d; <br>She drums her fingers along the armrest. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t ask him, how are you ever going to know for sure? Maybe he&#x2019;s waiting for you to show some interest.&#x201d; <br>I stare at the road and purse my lips. <br>&#x201c;Honestly.&#x201d; She sighs, turning back toward the window. &#x201c;Sometimes I don&#x2019;t know who&#x2019;s worse: you, or the five-year-old.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Dr. Collier and his wife stand in the spacious foyer of their home in Wellesley, underneath an elaborate chandelier, informally greeting their guests as they enter through the front door. It&#x2019;s been an unusually dry spring and summer, and the mosquito population is light, so the heavy oak front doors are thrown wide open to admit both a pleasant early-evening breeze and the guests streaming across the threshold. <br>Each year in July, Dr. Collier, the chairman of our department and my boss, has a cocktail party for all of the surgeons that work for him. He and his wife throw a pretty decent party. Beyond the foyer, in a living room with vaulted ceilings seemingly as high as a cathedral&#x2019;s, faculty and residents from my department stand around with drinks in their hands, clumped into groups of varying size and composition. They chat amiably as servers&#x2014;nubile young women wearing identical white dress shirts and long black pants&#x2014;circulate with blank smiles and hors d&#x2019;oeuvres laid out on silver platters. Along one side of the room, a string quartet plays classical music; on the opposite side, a bartender pours drinks from the Colliers&#x2019; ornate, marble-topped wet bar. <br>Dr. Collier himself is the spitting image of the actor Charlton Heston. Not the young, square-jawed, noble, 1950s Charlton Heston from the movie <i>The Ten Commandments</i>, but the older, crankier, more blustery 1960s and 1970s Charlton Heston from movies like <i>Planet of the Apes</i> and <i>The Omega Man</i> and <i>Soylent Green.</i> It&#x2019;s much more than just a passing resemblance, and I often wonder if Dr. Collier puts any conscious thought into imitating him. Tall, lanky, muscular, and uniformly bronzed even in the middle of January, his sinewy virility and biting cynicism are matched only by his propensity for spontaneously launching into bombastic speeches. <br>About the only non-Hestonesque thing about him is his musical preference in the operating room: show tunes. He&#x2019;s especially partial to <i>West Side Story.</i> Imagine watching Colonel Taylor from the original <i>Planet of the Apes</i> cut out somebody&#x2019;s kidney while humming along to &#x201c;I Feel Pretty,&#x201d; and you&#x2019;ll have some idea of what it&#x2019;s like to operate with Dr. Collier. <br>Tonight, he&#x2019;s wearing a light brown linen suit and pink dress shirt, no tie, with a pink paisley silk handkerchief neatly folded into the left breast pocket. <br>Sally and I approach Dr. and Mrs. Collier just as they&#x2019;re finishing speaking with one of the other residents. &#x201c;Steven,&#x201d; Dr. Collier says, shaking my hand briefly before focusing all of his attention on Sally. He smiles warmly and kisses her on the cheek. &#x201c;Good evening, Sally. Welcome to our home.&#x201d; <br>Mrs. Collier is a thin, graceful woman with long brown hair flecked with gray, friendly eyes, and a genteel Southern accent. Looking stylish in a sleeveless silver dress, she takes my hand first, then hugs Sally. Sally gushes over a console table that dominates the foyer (&#x201c;This wasn&#x2019;t here last year, was it?&#x201d;). Mrs. Collier beams her approval and responds that no, she only bought it just last month, and launches into a detailed description of the antique store in which she discovered it. <br>Dr. Collier takes the opportunity to ...</p><h2>AIDS: You Can&#39;t Catch It Holding Hands</h2><p>Provides the facts on how AIDS can and can&#39;t be transmitted, and how to prevent the spread of this disease, in the form of a letter from a mother to her son</p><p>Most people will agree that addressing the issue of AIDS with kids is inescapable, and, assuming that political uproar can be avoided by treating the disease solely as a human tragedy, how should it be done? This book takes a straight-talk strategy, with references to "vaginal fluids," "intestinal secretions," "making love" (oral, anal and vaginal sex), rubbers and phrases like "no sex parties," "but you can touch all over" and, for drug users, the advice "never share a needle." The amount of informationon sex and drugstaken for granted here, before readers are informed about AIDS, is astonishing. However, to dispel some fears, there are some invaluable facts for kids on how "you can't catch it" from a pet, an insect or a flower, or from food utensils, money, toilet seats, books or doorknobs. De Saint Phalle's colorful display of the facts, in a picture book format, gives readers badly needed relief from a morbid encounter with such a destructive force. But the art is quite sophisticated and explicit for readers of the picture-book age. This book may infuriate some and depress others. It unintentionally proves just how difficult it is to educate kids about AIDS without thrusting them, prematurely, into the hardcore realities of the adult world. Ages 10-up. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 9 Up Written as though it were a letter to ``Philip'' from his mother, this dreadful book has under 900 words and looks like a picture book done with crayons in imitation Matisse-cum-early Peter Max. It is handwritten, with many of the loops filled in with color, like the doodles many make during a boring phone call. An assortment of ways that the virus cannot be caught is listed, some as silly as flowers and ca naries. No scientific or sexual informa tion is given, except the caution to use ``rubbers'' which are pictured whimsi cally colored with snakes and hearts. The prose is choppy, and the grammar and punctuation are extremely uncon ventional. The advice is explicit with out elucidation, as though aimed at peo ple with a lot of sexual experience who can barely read. While this audience needs to be reached, the patronizing tone here will do so inadequately. The content is accurate but misleading. While nothing else on AIDS is available in a high-low format, the flippant style of this book will not serve readers. A better-written but equally cautionary ti tle with appeal for reluctant readers is Hawkes' AIDS (Gloucester, 1987).

He was a fellow and tutor in English literature at Oxford University until 1954, when he was unanimously elected to the chair of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University, a position he held until his retirement. His major contributions to literary criticism, children's literature, fantasy literature, and popular theology brought him international renown and acclaim. Lewis wrote more than thirty books, allowing him to reach a vast audience, and his works continue to attract thousands of new readers every year. His most distinguished and popular accomplishments include the Chronicles of Narnia, <em>Out of the Silent Planet</em>, <em>The Four Loves</em>, <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>, and <em>Mere Christianity</em>.</p><br><br><p><b>Simon Vance</b> is an award-winning actor and an AudioFile Golden Voice with over forty Earphones Awards. He has won thirteen prestigious Audie Awards and was <i>Booklist</i>'s very first Voice of Choice in 2008. He has narrated more than eight hundred audiobooks over almost thirty years, beginning when he was a radio newsreader for the BBC in London.</p>In 1933, not long after he became a Christian, Lewis published this third work and his first novel, a portrayal of this spiritual journey. Begun as a poem, Pilgrim's Regress thankfully ended up as an allegory that obviously takes its cue from John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Every bit as effective as its predecessor, Lewis's book describes the quest of John to reach the enchanted island and describes and satirizes many of the popular philosophies of the author's time, many of which also have more than a little influence in our day. Eloquent, erudite, and often witty, this tale is superbly narrated by Robert Whitfield. No stranger to the writings of Lewis, Whitfield has a well-modulated voice that easily portrays the numerous characters and gives the narrative sections a steady and consistent tempo. There are a number of Latin epigraphs, which are not translated. Public, religious/theological, and academic libraries should at least consider this audio. Michael T.

Melville was a little sophisticated for me; I had to wait until I was a sulky teenager to love &#x201c;Bartleby the Scrivener,&#x201d; and then I took to walking around the house murmuring &#x201c;I would prefer not to.&#x201d; My father, a Melville admirer, begged for mercy. At the same time that I was reading the great American 19th century short story, I was also discovering my father&#x2019;s library of pre- and post-World War II wits. Dorothy Parker was not just the funny, brittle woman at the Algonquin Table; she knew sadness and self-deception from the inside out and she could put it on the page with painful, personal frankness and not a bit of self-preserving paint or pretense. Her sentences are wry, but they bleed (&#x201c;The Big Blonde&#x201d;). I read S.J. Perelman, the Jewish smart-aleck of &#x201c;Westward Ha!&#x201d; and Robert Benchley, the urbane gentleman who could keep his head and his martini, even on an ice floe. (&#x201c;Drinking makes such fools of people, and people are such fools to begin with, it&#x2019;s just compounding a felony.&#x201d;) I read odd, funny, sometimes disturbing James Thurber and used his &#x201c;In the Catbird Seat&#x201d; to plan my comeuppance of my high school principal. <p></p> The great pleasure for me in writing short stories is the fierce, elegant challenge. Writing short stories requires Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart and some help from Gregory Hines. We are the cat burglars of the business: in and out in a relatively short time, quietly dressed (not for us the grand gaudiness of 600 pages and a riff on our favorite kind of breakfast cereal) to accomplish something shocking&#x2014;and lasting&#x2014;without throwing around the furniture. <p></p> Flannery O&#x2019;Connor (a reliable source when appreciating the short story) wrote that short stories deliver &#x201c;the experience of surprise&#x201d;. The surprise, I think, is that so few pages can contain so much, that what is taken to be a prism turns out to be not only a window, but a door, as well. <p></p> If you&#x2019;re an American reader, you can love short stories the way other Americans love baseball; this is our game, people! We have more than two hundred years of know-how and knack, of creativity. Of the folksy and the hip, of traditional yarn-spinning and innovative flourishes. Of men and women, of war and loss and love, with a few ghosts and many roads not taken. And in all of that, you will find some of the funniest and most heartbreaking fiction, ever. (You could take a break right now and go find Parker&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Waltz&#x201d; and Carver&#x2019;s &#x201c;Cathedral&#x201d;.) <p></p> Short stories have no net. The writer cannot take a leisurely sixty pages to get things moving, or make a side trip onto a barely related subject, or slack off in the last forty pages. Everything is right now, right here, in the reader&#x2019;s grasp and mind&#x2019;s eye. The writer has 20 to thirty pages to entice, seduce, enter and alter the reader. For me, the short story is the depth of a novel, the breadth of a poem and, as you come to the last few paragraphs, the experience of surprise. <p></p>Amy Bloom is the author of the bestselling and acclaimed <b>Away;</b> <i>Come to Me</i>, a National Book Award finalist; <i>A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You</i>, nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award; <i>Love Invents Us</i>; and <i>Normal</i>.

What it is, is a piece of insanity. <br><br>From the perspective of a hospital bed, through a drug-induced haze, Wellman's memory makes connections between events in life that his rational mind would never perceive...between a child's first hunting trip and a drunken weekend with Spencer Tracy, between working with Clark Gable and a recalcitrant St. Bernard in 'Call of the Wild' and working with Ernie Pyle and real fighting troops in 'GI Joe,' and between the friendship and courage and sorrow of flying in the Lafayette Escadrille and everything that ever happened in the rest of his life. <br><br>What it is, is a beautiful insight into the mind of a man who would have been called a genius if there'd been anybody willing to risk a black eye by calling him that. What it is, is a good and moving and funny and warm and honest...and a little crazy. Exactly like William Wellman.<br><br>In the halcyon days of Hollywood, Bill Wellman was known as a difficult man to get to know...hard and tough and more than a little fearsome. Still just as tough and no easier to know, 'A Short Time for Insanity,' at least makes him an easy man to love.</p><p></p><h2>VAMPIRE EXPRESS (Choose Your Own Adventure)</h2><p>The reader&#39;s choices determine what will happen on a vampire-seeking expedition to Romania</p><p></p><h2>Art &amp; Nature: An Illustrated Anthology of Nature Poetry</h2><p>A companion volume to Art &amp; Love presents poems that touch upon the magnificence of the world's wild places and includes works from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p></p><h2>How to Steal a Dog</h2><p><p><i>Half of me was thinking</i>, Georgina, don't do this. Stealing a dog is just plain wrong. <i>The other half of me was thinking</i>, Georgina, you're in a bad fix and you got to do whatever it takes to get yourself out of it.</p><p>Georgina Hayes is desperate. Ever since her father left and they were evicted from their apartment, her family has been living in their car. With her mama juggling two jobs and trying to make enough money to find a place to live, Georgina is stuck looking after her younger brother, Toby. And she has her heart set on improving their situation. When Georgina spots a missing-dog poster with a reward of five hundred dollars, the solution to all her problems suddenly seems within reach. All she has to do is "borrow" the right dog and its owners are sure to offer a reward. What happens next is the last thing she expected. </p><p>With unmistakable sympathy, Barbara O'Connor tells the story of a young girl struggling to see what's right when everything else seems wrong. </p><p><i>How to Steal a Dog</i> is a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p><p><b>Barbara O'Connor</b> is the author of numerous acclaimed books for children, including <i>Fame and Glory in Freedom, Georgia</i>; <i>Me and Rupert Goody</i>; and <i>Greetings from Nowhere</i>.

Mama is working two jobs to earn rent money and trying hard to hold things together. Desperate to help out, Georgina decides to steal a dog for the reward money, laying out the details of her plan in a diary. However, the dog's owner can't afford to offer a reward, and Georgina ends up feeling sorry for the lonely woman. The girl also makes friends with another adult named Mookie, a kindhearted wanderer who is camped out at the abandoned house where she is keeping the dog. He shares his wisdom and offers help, whether she wants it or not. Georgina's narrative is honest and deeply touching, as she recounts how she and her brother try to survive their circumstances. Washing off in a gas station restroom and turning in grease-stained homework become fairly normal occurrences. Readers will identify with the agony and the embarrassment caused by being different, as well as Georgina's struggles with her conscience. The book's endearing humor smoothes out the more poignant moments, and the unfolding events will keep youngsters totally engaged. The gem in the story is Mookie, who manages to sparkle even when sadness threatens to devour the moment. Though set inside a heavy topic, this novel's gentle storytelling carries a theme of love and emphasizes what is really right in the world.&#x2013;<i>Robyn Gioia, Bolles School, Ponte Vedra, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At present, the company operates workshops specializing in 16 distinct crafts--each employing experts of the highest order, from saddlers to tailors, perfumers, jewelers, hatmakers, cobblers, watchmakers and designers of printed silk or home decor. Within each craft, specific skills are broken into meticulously precise gestures, measurements and actions known by name only to the insiders. In this volume, authored by Olivier Saillard, director of the Galliera Museum of fashion in Paris, Herm�s for the first time in its history reveals 100 &#x201c;previously unspoken&#x201d; terms essential to its handcrafted ethos. With wit and poetry, Saillard explicates these terms, providing a glimpse into &#x201c;a territory dedicated to the hands, its range and variety of activity often unsuspected, a never ending ballet of agile fingers steadily handling tools over tamed materials.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>Philosophical Arguments</h2><p><p>Charles Taylor is one of the most important English-language philosophers at work today; he is also unique in the philosophical community in applying his ideas on language and epistemology to social theory and political problems. In this book Taylor brings together some of his best essays, including "Overcoming Epistemology," "The Validity of Transcendental Argument," "Irreducibly Social Goods," and "The Politics of Recognition." As usual, his arguments are trenchant, straddling the length and breadth of contemporary philosophy and public discourse.</p><p>The strongest theme running through the book is Taylor's critique of disengagement, instrumental reason, and atomism: that individual instances of knowledge, judgment, discourse, or action cannot be intelligible in abstraction from the outside world. By developing his arguments about the importance of "engaged agency," Taylor simultaneously addresses themes in philosophical debate and in a broader discourse of political theory and cultural studies. The thirteen essays in this collection reflect most of the concerns with which he has been involved throughout his career--language, ideas of the self, political participation, the nature of modernity. His intellectual range is extraordinary, as is his ability to clarify what is at stake in difficult philosophical disputes. Taylor's analyses of liberal democracy, welfare economics, and multiculturalism have real political significance, and his voice is distinctive and wise.</p></p><p>The essays in this collection reflect most of the concerns with which Charles Taylor has been involved throughout his career--language, ideas of the self, political participation, the nature of modernity.

Stewart. It tells the story of the fall of civilization from deadly disease and its rebirth. Beginning in the United States in the 1940s, it deals with Isherwood "Ish" Williams, Emma, and the community they founded. The survivors live off the remains of the old world, while learning to adapt to the new. Along the way they are forced to make tough decisions and choose what kind of civilization they will rebuild.</p><p> Earth Abides won the inaugural International Fantasy Award in 1951. It was included in Locus Magazine's list of best All Time Science Fiction in 1987 and 1998 and was a nominee to be entered into the Prometheus Hall Of Fame. In November 1950, it was adapted for the CBS radio program Escape as a two-part drama starring John Dehner.</p> <p>The book earned much praise from James Sallis, writing in the Boston Globe:</p> <p>This is a book, mind you, that I'd place not only among the greatest science fiction but among our very best novels. Each time I read it, I'm profoundly affected, affected in a way only the greatest art - Ulysses, Matisse or Beethoven symphonies, say - affects me. Epic in sweep, centering on the person of Isherwood Williams, Earth Abides proves a kind of antihistory, relating the story of humankind backwards, from ever-more-abstract civilization to stone-age primitivism. Everything passes - everything. Writers' reputations. The ripe experience of a book in which we find ourselves immersed. Star systems, worlds, states, individual lives. Humankind. Few of us get to read our own eulogies, but here is mankind's. Making Earth Abides a novel for which words like elegiac and transcendent come easily to mind, a novel bearing, in critic Adam-Troy Castro's words, "a great dark beauty."</p></p><p>A disease of unparalleled destructive force has sprung up almost simultaneously in every corner of the globe, all but destroying the human race. One survivor, strangely immune to the effects of the epidemic, ventures forward to experience a world without man. What he ultimately discovers will prove far more astonishing than anything he'd either dreaded or hoped for. <p>"From the Paperback edition.</p>George Rippey Stewart (May 31, 1895 &#x2013; August 22, 1980) was an American toponymist, a novelist, and a professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley.

These theories are not only untrue, it is not even science. It is fairy-tale physics:fantastical, bizarre and often outrageous, perhaps even confidence-trickery.This book provides a much-needed antidote. Informed,comprehensive, and balanced, it offers lay readers the latest ideas about the nature of physical reality while clearly distinguishing between fact and fantasy. With its engaging portraits of many central figures of modern physics, including Paul Davies, John Barrow, Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking,and Leonard Susskind, it promises to be essential reading forall readers interested in what we know and don&#x2019;t know about the nature of the universe and reality itself. graphs and charts</p><p><p>Modern physicists have spent decades struggling to explain the universe with more and more baroque theories. They&#x2019;re creative and complex&#x2014;and as Jim Baggott points out in review - Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth, largely unsupported by experimental evidence. Shining a spotlight on both fact and fancy, Baggott draws the line between valid science and &#x201c;fairy tale&#x201d; physics. </p> <p>Q: Where did modern physics &#x201c;go wrong&#x201d;? </p> <p>A: Theoretical physicists were faced with a choice. Either they could sit and wait for new data that might help guide them toward solutions, or they could build new theoretical structures without waiting for data. Of course, they couldn&#x2019;t wait. The end result is the creation of theoretical structures with great logical and mathematical appeal, but with no real empirical foundations&#x2014;in other words, metaphysics. </p> <p>Q: Is there something endemic to the field that invites this kind of abstraction? </p> <p>A: Not so much with the field of physics itself, but rather with aspects of physics that touch on the &#x201c;big questions&#x201d; of reality and human existence. Human beings have always desired to tell each other creation stories, and contemporary theoretical physicists are no different. It&#x2019;s really hard to resist. </p> <p>Q: You describe the Standard Model of particle physics as being riddled with problems. Has the recent discovery of the Higgs boson made things better or worse? </p> <p>A: It really depends on what you were hoping for. All the signs indicate that the particle discovered [at CERN] last July is the bog-standard Higgs boson. This is a triumph for the Standard Model, but it doesn&#x2019;t really move us forward. There are no real big surprises here, no new data to point toward resolving some of the Standard Model&#x2019;s thornier problems. I think it&#x2019;s fair to say that most high-energy physicists hoped for something more. But it seems we&#x2019;re not going to get it. </p> <p>Q: Is any part of modern theoretical physics salvageable? </p> <p>A: Funnily enough, I don&#x2019;t advocate any kind of major change of direction. I just want us all to acknowledge the difference between empirically based scientific theories and metaphysics, or pseudo-science. I would question whether we should be throwing all our eggs in the string theory/multiverse/cosmic landscape basket. Perhaps it&#x2019;s time to consider other ways we might address the problems with the &#x201c;authorized version&#x201d; of reality, wherein all the available observational and experimental data are essentially secondary to the prevailing theoretical structures. These other ways would suffer from a lack of empirical foundations just the way string theory does, but there&#x2019;s a saying that when you find yourself in a deep hole, maybe it&#x2019;s time to stop digging...</p>Jim Baggott is an award-winning science writer.

When the two begin their affair, he has an "understanding" with another woman, and Farol is married to her second husband. Theroux's third novel, after Three Wogs and Darconville's Cat, describes the rising and falling phases of their relationship in great psychological detail, focusing on Farol's, and also Ford's, inconstancy. Told from Ford's point of viewin a remote and superior tonethe story remains true to its narrator's shifting passions. Guilt, passion and will are topics for Theroux's intelligent, unstinting analysis, raising suggestions of earlier chroniclers of love in the works of Nabokov and Flaubert. But the questions of whether Farol will leave her husband, of how truthful she is about the rest of her life (and how reliable an observer Ford is) are slight fare for so extensive an examination. In the end, the obsessive narration and dearth of dialogue make for a reading experience as dry and remote as Ford's experience of love. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Christian Ford, a moderately successful painter wasting away in New Hampshire, begins dating a sad young woman named Farol Colorado. She tells him that she is about to divorce her husband, is in group therapy, and is slowly dying of multiple sclerosis. Ford falls hopelessly in love, but as his obsession grows, so too does his annoyance with Farol's superficiality, hypochondria, vindictiveness, and inability to break with her husband. Manic devotion to an undeserving woman is a favorite theme in works of writers from Benjamin Constant to Nabokov. Theroux, best known for the logorrheic extravaganza Darconville's Cat ( LJ 6/1/81), gives us a disturbing, misogynistic novel that invites comparison with such classics. For all fiction collections.

Stephen King himself has said that he finds his early work "raw," and Brian De Palma's movie was so successful that we feel as if we have read the novel even if we never have. The simple answer is that this is a very scary story, one that works as well, if not better, on the page as it does on the screen. Carrie White, bullied by cruel teenagers at school and her religious nut of a mother at home, gradually discovers that she has telekinetic powers, powers that will eventually be turned on her tormentors. King has a way of getting under the skin of his readers by creating an utterly believable world that throbs with menace before finally exploding. He builds the tension in this early work by piecing together extracts from newspaper reports, journals, and scientific papers, as well as more traditional first- and third-person narrative in order to reveal what lurks beneath the surface of Chamberlain, Maine. <blockquote>News item from the Westover (ME) weekly Enterprise, August 19, 1966: "Rain of Stones Reported: It was reliably reported by several persons that a rain of stones fell from a clear blue sky on Carlin Street in the town of Chamberlain on August 17th."</blockquote> Although the supernatural pyrotechnics are handled with King's customary aplomb, it is the carefully drawn portrait of the little horrors of small towns, high schools, and adolescent sexuality that give this novel its power and assures its place in the King canon. <i>--Simon Leake</i>El escalofriante caso de una joven en apariencia insignificante que se transform� en un ser de poderes anormales, sembrando el terror en su ciudad.

Bonds (<i>Stealing the General</i>) presents the epic story of what a Union observer called "the greatest event of the Civil War"--the struggle for the city of Atlanta and the terrible fate that then befell the town and its citizens. The title is taken from a letter that Union commander William Tecumseh Sherman wrote on the eve of his campaign into Georgia: "War, like the thunderbolt follows its laws," he said, "and turns not aside even if the beautiful, the virtuous and charitable stand in its path."

Benedicte Maurseth is one of his most accomplished students, an internationally known artist who has recorded for the ECM label. In a book that brings to mind such classics as <i>Zen and the Art of Archery</i> and <i>Wabi Sabi</i>, the student and her master together explore the quest for excellence and originality in the heart of a living tradition. </p><p>At once mystical and practical, <i>To Be Nothing</i> is a series of dialogues about music, learning, teaching, the healing power of art, and the art of life itself.

He's always been old, he's always been young. There is a kind of equanimity in him; a rooted feeling. What you see is what there is, but at the same time there are layers behind layers.

These and other bizarre events begin occurring shortly after Gregory Tomasov returns to his old hometown of McGuane, Ariz., with his wife and three children. The old adage "You can't go home again" has perhaps never rung more true, as Bram Stoker Award-winner Little (The House) draws upon elements of religion, the supernatural, sexual fantasy and psychological horror to create a modern-day ghost town. Almost immediately after they unwittingly move into an old farmhouse where a deranged man once murdered his family and committed suicide, the Tomasovs are transformed. The two younger children become obsessed with the shadows inside the home's bathhouse, shadows that eat dead animals, torment children and kill mercilessly. As the deaths mount and small-town life becomes more dangerous and freakish, residents begin to blame the Tomasovs, whom they believe carry some kind of curse. Not until the terrifying finale, which takes place during a sandstorm and blackout, does everyone realize the evil's roots. What, in a lesser writer's hands, would have been an obvious conclusion remains a mystery until the end. While reminiscent of Dean Koontz and Stephen King, Little crafts his own vivid landscape full of dark corners, twisted characters and a gruesome plot.

Jenkyns's view of ancient literature is Olympian.&#x201d;</b><br><br>The writings of the Greeks and Romans form the bedrock of Western culture. Inventing the molds for histories, tragedies, and philosophies, while pioneering radical new forms of epic and poetry, the Greeks and Romans created the literary world we still inhabit today. Writing with verve and insight, distinguished classicist Richard Jenkyns explores a thousand years of classical civilization, carrying readers from the depths of the Greek dark ages through the glittering heights of Rome's empire.<br><br>Jenkyns begins with Homer and the birth of epic poetry before exploring the hypnotic poetry of Pindar, Sappho, and others from the Greek dark ages. Later, in Athens's classical age, Jenkyns shows the radical nature of Sophocles's choice to portray Ajax as a psychologically wounded warrior, how Aeschylus developed tragedy, and how Herodotus, in inventing history,&#x201d; brought to narrative an epic and tragic quality. We meet the strikingly modern figure of Virgil, struggling to mirror epic art in an age of empire, and experience the love poems of Catullus, who imbued verse with obsessive passion as never before. Even St. Paul and other early Christian writers are artfully grounded here in their classical literary context.<br><br>A dynamic and comprehensive introduction to Greek and Roman literature, Jenkyns's <i>Classical Literature</i> is essential reading for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the classics and the extraordinary origins of Western culture.<br><br><b><i>Library Journal,</i> STARRED review<br> [R]ich, witty, perceptive, and brief...

Lendon, professor of history, University of Virginia, and author of <i>Song of Wrath</i> and <i>Soldiers and Ghosts</i></b><br> In outlining the lofty, uncompromising, literary tradition of ancient Greece and Rome, by some magic Richard Jenkyns preserves and conveys the nobility and sublimity of his subject. The reader for whom this book is an introduction to the Classics will come away with a grasp of why classical writings are the irreplaceable soul of the West, while the reader who fancies his classical learning will be humbled by a rush of new ideas about works he or she thought long tamed.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Christopher Pelling, Emeritus Regius Professor of Greek, University of Oxford</b><br> If you want to know why the best classical authors are very, very good, this is the book for you beautifully written, with a feeling for style on every page.

Bowersock, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><br> In this short book, written in artfully uncomplicated prose, Jenkyns not only informs his readers about all the major authors of Greek and Roman antiquity but invariably delivers fresh, arresting, and by no means uncontroversial opinions on most of them.

There is scarcely anything on which he does not offer an original aper�u, sometimes illuminating, sometimes simply provocative, but always worth reading... Jenkyns's view of ancient literature is Olympian. He sees it from a great height, with a sharp eye and broad vision, and what he sees is never clouded or obscure.

Original.</p><p>Janny Wurts is the author of eleven novels, a collection of short stories, and the internationally best selling Empire trilogy written in collaboration with Raymond E. Feist. Her current release in her Wars of Light and Shadow series, Grand Conspiracy, and her forthcoming hardcover, Peril's Gate, are the culmination of more than twenty years of carefully evolved ideas. The cover images on the books, both in the US and abroad, are her own paintings, depicting her vision of characters and setting.<p>Through her combined talents as a writer/illustrator, Janny has immersed herself in a lifelong ambition: to create a seamless interface between words and pictures that will lead reader and viewer beyond the world we know. Her lavish use of language lures the mind into a crafted realm of experience, with characters and events woven into a complex tapestry, and drawn with an intensity to leave a lasting impression. Her research includes a range of direct experience, lending her fantasy a gritty realism, and her scenes involving magic an almost visionary credibility. A self&#x2013;taught painter, she draws directly from the imagination, creating scenes in a representational style that blurs the edges between dream and reality. She makes no preliminary sketches, but envisions her characters and the scenes that contain them, then executes the final directly from the initial pencil drawing.</p><p>The seed idea for the Wars of Light and Shadow series occurred, when, in the course of researching tactic and weapons, she viewed a documentary film on the Battle of Culloden Moor. This was the first time she had encountered the historical context of that brutal event, with the embroidery of romance stripped from it. The experience gave rise to an awakening, which became anger, that so often, our education, literature and entertainment slant history in a manner that equates winners and losers with moral right and wrong, and the prevalent attitude, that killing wars can be seen as justifiable solutions when only one side of the picture is presented. </p><p>Her series takes the stance that there are two sides to every question, and follows two characters who are half brothers. One a bard trained as a master of magecraft, and the other a born ruler with a charismatic passion for justice, have become cursed to lifelong enmity. As one sibling raises a devoted mass following, the other tries desperately to stave off defeat through solitary discipline and cleverness. The conflict sweeps across an imaginary world, dividing land and people through an intricate play of politics and the inborn prejudices of polarized factions already set at odds. Readers are led on a journey that embraces both viewpoints. The story explores the ironies of morality which often confound our own human condition-that what appears right and just, by one side, becomes reprehensible when seen from the opposite angle. What is apparently good for the many, too often causes devastating suffering to the nonconformist minority. Through the interactions between the characters themselves, the reader is left to their own discretion to interpret the moral impact of events. </p><p>Says Janny of her work, "I chose to frame this story against a backdrop of fantasy because I could handle even the most sensitive issues with the gloves off-explore the myriad angles of our troubled times with the least risk of offending anyone's personal sensibilities. The result, I can hope, is an expanding journey of the spirit that explores the grand depths, and rises to the challenge of mapping the ethereal potential of an evolving planetary consciousness." </p><p>Beyond writing, Janny's award winning paintings have been showcased in exhibitions of imaginative artwork, among them a commemorative exhibition for NASA's 25th Anniversary; the Art of the Cosmos at Hayden Planetarium in New York; and two exhibits of fantasy art, at both the Delaware Art Museum, and Canton Art Museum.</p>This stout and epic tale mixing fantasy and SF was originally published in the 1980s in mass market in three volumes, Stormwarden, Keeper of the Keys and Shadowfane. Whether those novels have been edited for this edition or not, the joint publication brings out the essential unity of the story. Far in the future, a human-crewed starship crashes on a distant planet, carrying a load of alien POWs taken to help discover the secrets of a deadly foe, the group mind known as the Gierj. In time, the humans revert to a feudal society, the aliens are seen as "demons" and the starship's computer survives as a "magical" entity known as the Vaere. Two powerful human wizards learn the mental techniques (or magic) of the Vaere, but one, Ivain Firelord, dies mad, and the other, Anskiere Stormwarden, is distrusted and imprisoned. The burden of fighting the Shadowfane, the realm of the demons, falls on Taen Dreamweaver, a fisherman's daughter, and on an orphan boy named Jaric, who is actually Ivain's bastard son. They are in a race against time to master Vaere powers, because the Shadowfane are on the march, and Taen's brother has become a minion of the Shadowfane, known as Maelgrim Dark Dreamer. The race is full of action, splendid scenes of magic (including some terrifying dreams) and engaging secondary characters. It also has many well-handled seafaring scenes (Robin Hobb's Liveship Saga fans, take note) and an amiable, even tender romance subplot. Jaric and Taen are the eventual victors, but not without cost, nor without the possibility of future adventures among the stars and against the Gierj.

Millett is Professor of History and Director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at The University of New Orleans.<br><br>Peter Maslowski is professor of history at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln.<b>Chapter One</b> <p> <i>A Dangerous New World</i></p><p><i> 1607-1689</i> </p><p> Crossing the Atlantic during the seventeenth century was a perilous voyage, entailing weeks or months of cramped quarters, inadequate food, and unsanitary conditions. Yet in the late 1500s Englishmen had begun to hazard the venture, and in 1607 they planted their first permanent settlement on the North American continent at Jamestown. By the early 1730s, thirteen separate colonies hugged the seaboard. Although great diversity prevailed among the colonies, most colonists shared a common English heritage and clung to it tenaciously. Their religious attitudes, economic views, political thoughts, and military ideals and institutions were all grounded in English history. In no aspect of colonial life was this heritage more important than in regard to military matters. The colonists' most revered military institution (the militia) and their most cherished military tradition (fear of a standing army) both came from England. </p><p> <b>I</b> </p><p> The earliest English settlers arrived in a dangerous New World. The initial colonies represented little more than amphibious landings on a hostile coastline followed by the consolidation of small, insecure beach-heads. The settlers did not take possession of an uninhabited land, but settled in regions controlled by various native American tribes. Fortunately for the colonists, they unwittingly landed in areas that had recently experienced precipitous population losses among the Indians. </p><p> Europeans made periodic contact with the natives long before they established permanent colonies. These transient visitors left a devastating legacy of smallpox, measles, and other European diseases, for which the natives had no built-in immunities. But the colonists soon learned that the Indians, even in their weakened state, were a formidable adversary. Nor were Indians the only military threat. The English settled in lands also claimed by their European rivals, and the memory of the raids conducted by the Spanish, French, and English against each other's out-posts in the Caribbean and along the Florida coast undoubtedly haunted many colonists. The fear of pillaging buccaneers and pirates who infested coastal waterways compounded the potential problem posed by European enemies. </p><p> Colonists faced these threats alone. Although the English monarch authorized their expeditions and granted extensive lands for settlement, the Crown expected the colonists to defend themselves. With few illusions about their precarious position, colonists came to the New World armed and, anticipating conflict, gave prompt attention to defense. Professional soldiers accompanied the expeditions to Jamestown, Plymouth, and succeeding colonies. Indeed, the first heroes in American history were far from ordinary settlers. The profit-seeking Virginia Company hired Captain John Smith, a veteran of Europe's religious wars, to teach military skills to the settlers at Jamestown in 1607. Other experienced soldiers, such as Lord De La Warr, Sir Thomas Gates, and Sir Thomas Dale, soon followed him. The pious Pilgrims wisely did not rely on God's favor alone for protection, employing Captain Myles Standish, a veteran of the Dutch wars for independence, to ensure Plymouth's success. Although Smith and Standish are the most famous of the soldier-settlers, practically all the other colonies had similar veterans who provided military leadership during the founding period. The importance placed on military preparations could be seen in the attention given to fortifications. Less than a month after their arrival, the settlers at Jamestown had constructed a primitive, triangular fort, and by 1622 the Pilgrims had erected a 2,700-foot-long defensive perimeter guarding their fledgling plantation. </p><p> The most important response to the dangerous military realities was the creation of a militia system in each colony. The British military heritage, the all-pervasive sense of military insecurity, and the inability of the economically poor colonies to maintain an expensive professional army all combined to guarantee that the Elizabethan militia would be transplanted to the North American wilderness. No colonial institution was more complex than the militia. In many respects it was static and homogeneous, varying little from colony to colony and from generation to generation. Yet the militia was also evolutionary and heterogeneous, as diverse as the thirteen colonies and ever-changing within individual colonies. </p><p> At the heart of the militia was the principle of universal military obligation for all able-bodied males. Colonial laws regularly declared that all able-bodied men between certain ages automatically belonged to the militia. Yet within the context of this immutable principle, variations abounded. While the normal age limits were from 16 to 60, this was not universal practice. Connecticut, for example, began with an upper age limit of 60 but gradually reduced it to 45. Sometimes the lower age limit was 18 or even 21. Each colony also established occupational exemptions from militia training. Invariably the exemption list began small but grew to become a seemingly endless list that reduced the militia's theoretical strength. </p><p> If a man was in the militia, he participated in periodic musters, or training days, with the other members of his unit. Attendance at musters was compulsory; militia laws levied fines for nonattendance. During the initial years of settlement, when dangers seemed particularly acute, musters were frequent. However, as the Indian threat receded, the trend was toward fewer muster days, and by the early 1700s most colonies had decided that four peacetime musters per year were sufficient. </p><p> Whether few or many, muster days helped forge a link between religious duty and military service, particularly in New England. An integral part of each training day (and of all military expeditions) was a sermon, which invariably fostered an aggressive militancy by emphasizing that the Bible sanctioned martial activity and that warfare was a true Christian's sacred duty. "Hence it is no wayes unbecoming a Christian to learn to be a Souldier," chaplain Samuel Nowell preached to Massachusetts militiamen in 1678, because being a soldier was "a Credit, a praise and a glory." When the colonists unsheathed their swords, they did so in God's name, serene in the belief that the Lord was on their side against their heathen and Papist enemies and that whatever happened was God's will. </p><p> Militiamen had to provide and maintain their own weapons. Militia laws detailed the required weaponry, which underwent a rapid evolution in the New World. Initially a militiaman was armed much like a European soldier, laden with armor, equipped with either a pike or matchlock musket, and carrying a sword. But Indian warfare was not European warfare, and most of this weaponry proved of limited value. By the mid-1670s colonial armaments had been revolutionized. Armor, which made it difficult to traverse rugged terrain and pursue Indians, disappeared. Pikes were equally cumbersome and of little use against Indians, who neither stood their ground when assaulted nor made massed charges. At times the matchlock was superior to Indian bows and arrows, but its disadvantages were many. It took two minutes to load, and misfired approximately three times in every ten shots. The weapon discharged when a slow-burning match came in contact with the priming powder, but keeping the match lit on rainy or windy days was difficult, and the combination of a burning match and gunpowder in close proximity often resulted in serious accidents. The flintlock musket replaced the matchlock. Depending on flint scraping against steel for discharge, flintlocks could be loaded in thirty seconds and misfired less often. Swords remained common weapons, but colonists increasingly preferred hatchets for close-quarter combat. Although both weapons were valuable in a melee, hatchets were also useful for a variety of domestic purposes. </p><p> Militia laws emphasized the importance of a well-armed citizenry in numerous ways. To ensure that each man had the requisite weapons and accoutrements, colonies instituted a review of arms, imposing the duty. of conducting it on militia officers, muster masters, or other specially appointed officials. Every colony's law detailed how destitute citizens could be armed at public expense, and legislatures provided for public arsenals to supplement individually owned armaments. Colonies also required that even men exempted from attending musters should be completely armed and equipped. </p><p> Although the basic tactical unit in all the colonies was the company, or trainband, regional variations and changes over time were as important as the superficial uniformity. No standardized company size existed, some companies containing as few as sixty-five men and others as many as two hundred. Some trainbands elected their officers, but in others the governors appointed them. Southern colonies, with widely dispersed populations, often organized companies on a countywide basis, while in New England, with its towns and villages, individual communities contained their own trainbands. As populations increased and the number of trainbands grew, colonies organized companies into regiments to preserve efficient management. As one last example of the variety and change within militia units, the initial all-infantry composition evolved into a mixture of infantry and mounted units, the latter providing increased maneuverability and speed, which were valuable assets in Indian warfare. </p><p> Militia officers, like colonial politicians, overwhelmingly came from the upper class, and men moved with ease from important political positions into high military offices and vice versa. The practice of plural office holding, whereby a man simultaneously held political and military office, epitomized the integration of political and military leadership. For example, in Salem, Massachusetts, between 1765 and 1774 twelve of the twenty-nine active militia officers also held important positions in the municipal government.

Cereal. Crackers. Spaghetti. Beer. I lived alone, worked a lot, and rarely cooked. I was checking a price when I almost ran into the girl. I stopped immediately and studied her in profile, her hand raised to her mouth while she examined products through the glass door of the dairy cooler.</p><p>I felt like I was seeing a ghost.</p><p>She looked exactly like my college girlfriend, Marissa Minor, the only woman I had ever really loved. Probably the only woman who had ever really loved me.</p><p>The girl didn&#x2019;t see me right away. She continued to examine the items in front of her, slowly walking away from me, her hand still raised to her mouth as though that helped her think.</p><p>The gesture really got me. It made my insides go cold. Not with fear, but with shock. With feelings I hadn&#x2019;t felt in years.</p><p>Marissa used to do the very same thing. When she was thinking, she&#x2019;d place her right hand on her lips, sometimes pinching them between her index finger and thumb. Marissa&#x2019;s lips were always bright red&#x2014;without lipstick&#x2014;and full, and that gesture, that lip-twisting, thoughtful gesture, drove me wild with love and, yes, desire.</p><p>I was eighteen when I met her. Desire was always close at hand.</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t just the gesture that this girl shared with Marissa. Her hair, thick and deep red, matched Marissa&#x2019;s exactly, even the length of it, just below her shoulders. From the side, the girl&#x2019;s nose came to a slightly rounded point, one that Marissa always said looked like a lightbulb. Both the girl and Marissa had brown eyes, and long, slender bodies. This girl, the one in the store, looked shorter than Marissa by a few inches, and she wore tight jeans and knee-high boots, clothes that weren&#x2019;t in style when I attended college.</p><p>But other than that, they could have been twins. They really could have been.</p><p>And as the girl walked away, making a left at the end of the aisle and leaving my sight, I remained rooted to my spot, my silly little grocery basket dangling from my right hand. The lights above were bright, painfully so, and other shoppers came past with their carts and their kids and their lives. It was close to dinnertime, and people had places to go. Families to feed.</p><p>But I stood there.</p><p>I felt tears rising in my eyes, my vision starting to blur.</p><p>She looked so much like Marissa. So much.</p><p>But Marissa had been dead for just over twenty years.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Finally, I snapped out of it.</p><p>I reached up with my free hand and wiped my eyes.</p><p>No one seemed to notice that I was having an emotional moment in the middle of the grocery store, in the milk aisle. I probably looked like a normal guy. Forty years old. Clean-cut. Professional. I had my problems. I was divorced. My ex-wife didn&#x2019;t let me see her son as much as I wanted. He wasn&#x2019;t my kid, but we&#x2019;d grown close. My job as a caseworker for the housing authority in Eastland, Ohio, didn&#x2019;t pay enough, but who ever felt like they were paid enough? I enjoyed the work. I enjoyed helping people. I tended to pour myself into it.</p><p>Outside of work, I spent my life like a lot of single people do. I socialized with friends, even though most of them were married and had kids. I played in a recreational basketball league. When I had the time and motivation, I volunteered at our local animal shelter, walking dogs or making fund-raising calls.</p><p>Like I said, I probably looked like a regular guy.</p><p>I decided I needed to talk to that girl. I started down the aisle, my basket swinging at my side. I figured she had to be a relative of Marissa&#x2019;s, right? A cousin or something. I turned the corner in the direction she had gone, deftly dodging between my fellow shoppers.</p><p>I looked up the next aisle and didn&#x2019;t see her. Then I went to another one, the last aisle in the store. At first, I didn&#x2019;t see the girl there either. It was crowded, and a family of four&#x2014;two parents, two kids&#x2014;blocked my view. One of the kids was screaming because her mom wouldn&#x2019;t buy her the ice cream she wanted.</p><p>But then they moved, and I saw the girl. She was halfway down the aisle, opening the door of another cooler, but not removing anything. She lifted her hand to her mouth. That gesture. She looked just like Marissa.</p><p>I felt the tears again and fought back against them.</p><p>I walked up to her. She looked so small. And young. I guessed she was about twenty, probably a student at my alma mater, Eastland University. I felt ridiculous, but I had to ask who she was. I wiped at my eyes again and cleared my throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She whipped her head around in my direction. She seemed startled that anyone had spoken to her.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>But I really wasn&#x2019;t. In that moment, I saw her head-on instead of in profile, and the resemblance to Marissa became more pronounced. Her forehead was a little wider than Marissa&#x2019;s. And her chin came to a sharper point. But the spray of freckles, the shape of her eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all of it was Marissa.</p><p>If I believed in ghosts&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Ghosts from a happy time in my past&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said again.</p><p>The girl just looked at me. Her eyes moved across my body, sizing me up. Taking me in. She looked guarded.</p><p>&#x201c;I was wondering if you were related to the Minor family,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They lived in Hanfort, Ohio. It&#x2019;s been about twenty years since I&#x2019;ve seen them. I know it&#x2019;s a long shot&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The girl had been holding a box of Cheerios and a carton of organic milk. When I said the name &#x201c;Minor,&#x201d; she let them both go, and they fell to the floor at my feet. The milk was in a cardboard carton, but the force of it hitting the floor caused it to split open. Milk leaked onto the cruddy linoleum, flowing toward my shoes.</p><p>&#x201c;Careful,&#x201d; I said, reaching out for her.</p><p>But the girl took off. She made an abrupt turn and started walking away briskly, her bootheels clacking against the linoleum. She didn&#x2019;t look back. And when she reached the far end of the aisle, the end closest to the cash registers, she started running.</p><p>I took one step in that direction, lifting my hand. I wanted to say something. Apologize. Call her back. Let her know that I hadn&#x2019;t meant any harm.</p><p>But she was gone.</p><p>Just like Marissa, she was gone.</p><p>Then the family of four, the one I had seen earlier with the child screaming for ice cream, came abreast of me. The child appeared to have calmed down. She clutched a carton of Rocky Road, the tears on her face drying. The father pointed to the mess on the floor, the leaking milk and the cereal.</p><p>&#x201c;Something wrong with her?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>My hands were shaking. I felt off-balance. Above my head, the cloying Muzak played, indifferent to my little drama with the girl who looked so much like Marissa.</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know who she was.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>I thought of Marissa all evening. It&#x2019;s safe to say I was feeling a little sorry for myself. Indulging in nostalgia, which can be enjoyable up to a point.</p><p>I drank beer on the couch in my apartment while a basketball game I didn&#x2019;t care about played on the TV. A pile of work waited in my briefcase, but I ignored it. I never did that, but after seeing the girl in the store, I did. I ate some cheese and crackers but gave up on my plan to cook the spaghetti I&#x2019;d bought. My only company that night was Riley, the aging mutt I&#x2019;d rescued from the local humane society shortly after my divorce two years earlier. I volunteered there to keep myself busy and to give something back. Eventually, they convinced me to take a dog home. He looked to be a mixture of German shepherd and retriever, and the humane society had estimated his age to be at least eight when I adopted him, maybe older.</p><p>The humane society didn&#x2019;t know much about Riley&#x2019;s life before he was abandoned to their care, but they suspected he&#x2019;d suffered some neglect or abuse, because he was so passive and skittish when I adopted him. He used to jump and cower at every noise, and he rarely if ever barked or growled. He&#x2019;d grown slowly more comfortable and confident over the previous couple of years, and I&#x2019;d grown used to having him around. As I lounged on the couch, brooding, he sat at my feet, hoping for cracker crumbs.</p><p>Marissa and I had met during our freshman year at Eastland University. When I thought of who I was when I arrived at college, I realized I was just an awkward man-boy who only dreamed of meeting his soul mate. Marissa was beautiful, confident, outgoing, determined. Meeting her unlocked things in me that might never have been unlocked otherwise. She got me like no one ever had. And no one has since. We understood each other without words. I felt my connection to her in the deepest core of my being. How many people meet someone like that in their lives? Not many, but I did. And then, two years later, she was taken away from me in a house fire on a warm fall weekend.</p><p>That was why seeing the girl in the grocery store shook me to the core. I had managed to get on with my life. I had managed to tell myself I&#x2019;d gotten over losing Marissa.</p><p>But I hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>I went into my bedroom and dug around in the bottom of my closet. I kept a shoebox there full of items from my time in college, mostly things from my relationship with Marissa. Letters, notes, ticket stubs. And the multiple-time-zone watch she gave me on my twentieth birthday.</p><p>We were supposed to travel after college, which explained the need for a multiple-time-zone watch. We never got to take those trips, and I never wore the watch again after Marissa died. But I kept it, and from time to time I&#x2019;d take it out of the box. When the battery died every few years, I&#x2019;d take the watch to the jewelry store and have it replaced. I liked to think about that watch being there, close by me, and always running like a beating heart.</p><p>I brought it back to the couch with me and slumped down into the cushions, opening another beer. I was supposed to play in my basketball league, but I just didn&#x2019;t feel like it. I never drank very much, never more than one a day, if that, but when I came home from the grocery store that night, I threw back three and then four and opened a fifth, staring at my watch and wondering who that girl was. And why she&#x2019;d acted so damn spooked when I simply spoke to her.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>I fell asleep on the couch, the TV still playing, the open but unfinished fifth beer on the coffee table before me. My neck felt like hell from sleeping at an odd angle, and a trail of drool ran down my chin.</p><p>I slept until something started beating against my apartment door.</p><p>Someone was there, pounding on the outside. Each heavy knock caused a miniature earthquake in my skull. I winced. A hangover at my age. Pathetic. I vowed never to have more than one beer again. I vowed to stop thinking about Marissa.</p><p>I probably would have agreed to anything to get the pounding on the door to stop. But it didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>I turned my head to the right, looking at the watch Marissa gave me. 6:53 a.m. 12:53 a.m. the next day in New Zealand, as if I needed to know that.</p><p>I normally woke up around eight. Made it to the office by nine. But I felt like shit. I needed a shower. Coffee. Food. I stood up, feeling a little wobbly. I looked down at Riley. He hadn&#x2019;t barked despite the pounding on the door. He never barked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing?&#x201d; I said to him. &#x201c;Not even a growl?&#x201d;</p><p>His tail thumped against the floor, and he yawned.</p><p>&#x201c;One of these days I&#x2019;m really going to need your help,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re ready.&#x201d;</p><p>Riley walked off toward the kitchen, which meant he was hungry.</p><p>I was still wearing my work clothes from the day before. My tie and my shoes were off, and I needed to pee. But whoever was outside the door really wanted to talk to me. The person beat on the door again, shaking my brain like dice in a cup.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Jesus.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought about calling the apartment complex security guard and asking him to find out who was making the endless racket. But he was an elderly man, the owner&#x2019;s uncle, and he usually didn&#x2019;t arrive until late morning and was gone by five. The noise wasn&#x2019;t the knock of a friend or someone selling something. It sounded urgent, determined. But my desire to make it stop overwhelmed any fears I had about who was out there. I stumbled to the door and looked through the peephole.</p><p>It took a moment for the scene outside to make sense to me, but when it did, my heart started racing.</p><p>I understood immediately why the knock was so heavy.</p><p>Through the peephole I saw two uniformed police officers and a detective I already knew.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Hansen,&#x201d; the detective said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Eastland Police. We know you&#x2019;re in there. Open up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>An already rough morning became totally shitty.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>The morning sun nearly killed me.</p><p>It poured in when I opened the door, its rays penetrating my eyeballs like knitting needles. I took a step back, feeling as if I were a man under siege.</p><p>&#x201c;Can we come in?&#x201d; the detective said.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t have to answer. He was already stepping across the threshold with the two uniformed officers right behind him.</p><p>&#x201c;You can do anything you want if it means you&#x2019;ll stop knocking,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Detective Reece stood about five-nine, a few inches shorter than me, but he was powerfully and compactly built. I suspected he&#x2019;d wrestled in high school. Or maybe played nose tackle at a small college. He looked like that kind of guy. He didn&#x2019;t offer to shake my hand, but I&#x2019;d shaken it before, the last time he and I had encountered each other. I remembered he possessed a strong grip, and I always pictured him sitting at his desk, endlessly squeezing one of those hand strengtheners.</p><p>Reece saw the beer cans on the coffee table, and he raised his eyebrows. He was probably a few years younger than me, and his hair was thinning. He wore it cropped close to his head, and his suit coat looked too small for him.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s recycling day,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Think green, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He pointed at Riley. &#x201c;Does the dog bite?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only his food,&#x201d; I said, trying to keep the mood light.</p><p>But Reece wasn&#x2019;t smiling. He looked around the room, taking it all in. The TV still played with the sound down, showing highlights of a hockey game from the night before. There were dirty dishes in my sink, discarded gym clothes on the floor. I needed to pick up, and I would have if I&#x2019;d only known the police were going to show up.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you seen your ex-wife lately?&#x201d; Reece asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not in six weeks,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Not since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that night you and I met.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The night of the late unpleasantness,&#x201d; Reece said.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t stalking her.&#x201d;</p><p>Reece turned to one of the uniformed officers. &#x201c;He says he wasn&#x2019;t stalking her. The ex-wife says he was. Who would you believe?&#x201d;</p><p>The young uniformed cop didn&#x2019;t answer....</p></p><h2>The Journey Toward God: In the Footsteps of the Great Spiritual Writers - Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox</h2><p>To know God is the deepest human desire.

Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that "After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man."<br><br>NPR calls his work "adventurous and enormously engrossing..." and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: "If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional.

He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.<br><br>Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice.

But the most disturbing aspect of Agent Gerald Clark's death has his superiors in Washington baffled. When Agent Clark first came to the Amazon, he had only one arm-the result of a well-paced sniper's bullet. But the photograph of him submitted by a Brazilian morgue shows a corpse with two upper limbs fully intact.<br><br> Nathan Rand has made the Amazon region his home since his father led a scientific mission into the lush green wilderness and never returned-the same doomed expedition that took Gerald Clark into the jungle. Now the government wants Nate to follow the elder Rand's trail, accompanied by a team of scientists and a phalanx of experienced U.S. Rangers. For somewhere in the dark, impenetrable depths of the most dangerous region on Earth there are mysteries that must be solved, no matter what the cost in money, materials...or lives.<br><br> There are undreamed-of perils here in this breathtaking world where devouring insects rule, diseases unknown to modern science flourish, and rivers teem with hungry, flesh-eating predators. As Nate Rand and his party push deeper into the jungle, they are haunted by an ugly truth that cannot be dismissed and, perhaps, will not be survived: They are not alone...and they are bing stalked.<br><br> But the threat of mortal hungers poles before the nightmare that awaits fourteen unsuspecting men and women, as each step brings them closer to an ancient, unspoken terror that even the native people dread. And as madness, fear, and horrific, death descend upon the second cursed Rand expedition , those still living are imagining-one that can forever alter the world beyond the dark, lethal confines of the Amazon rainforest for betters...and for worse.</p><h2>God Still Matters (Continuum Icons)</h2><p><p>Herbert McCabe, who died in 2001, was one of the most intelligent Roman Catholic thinkers of the twentieth century.

Equally at home in philosophy and theology, he despised jargon and intellectual posturing as a substitute for reason and argument. At the time of his death, he left a wealth of unpublished material- so outstanding in its quality and originality that it is surprising that it was never published in book form. This is now put to rights. In God Still Matters we have the chance to read McCabe on the topics that interested him most - philosophy of God, Christology, Fundamental theology, Sacramental theology and ethics.

Now he takes the next step, turning his keen analytical focus on how human greed, stupidity and horniness will shape the future. <p> With this book, Adams follows in the footsteps of other great futurists, i.e., sitting at home making stuff up that can't be proven wrong for many years. Featuring the same mix of essays and cartoons that made <em>The Dilbert Principle</em> so uniquely entertaining, <em>The Dilbert Future</em> offers predictions on business, technology, society and government. Nobody is spared this time. Some predictions: </p><p> </p><li>Children: They are our future, so we're pretty much hosed. Tip: Grab what you can while they're still too little to stop us. <p> </p></li><li>Human Potential: We'll finally learn to use the 90 percent of the brain we don't use today, and find out that there wasn't anything in that part. <p> </p></li><li>Longevity: We'll all live to 140. The Olympics will expand to include new events such as Complaining and Slow Driving. <p> </p></li><li>Computers: Technology and homeliness will combine to form a powerful type of birth control.</li></p><p>Move over, Faith Popcorn! Cartoonist Scott Adams is back in book form, and this time he gives Dilbert and his cronies a free hand to forecast the trends that just might drive business and society during the next millennium. In typical Adams fashion, <i>The Dilbert Future: Thriving on Stupidity in the 21st Century</i> serves up a series of laugh-out-loud predictions on technology, marketing, work, jobs, gender relations, and even the future of democracy and capitalism."The future," Scott Adams declares, "is an excellent topic for any author. By the time you realize I was wrong about everything I predicted, I will be dead . . . And let's say a copy of this book somehow gets encased in amber and trapped in a tar pit . . . Eons from now, when our descendants find it, they will read my predictions and believe that I was a wise holy man." <p> With <b>The Dilbert Future: Thriving on Stupidity in the 21st Century</b> Adams' legion of fans doesn't have to wait eons to discover his wisdom. A hilarious compendium of predictions, <b>The Dilbert Future</b> is designed to help readers guard themselves against any unpleasant surprises during the next millennium. </p><p> While some people try to predict the future by assuming current trends will continue, Adams reminds us that something unexpected always happens to wreck any good trend. For example, although computers allow us to work 100% faster (a good trend), they generate 300% more work (an unexpected, bad thing). On the more positive side, Adams also demonstrates that the indomitable human spirit usually rises to defeat predictions of doom: fears that the population would grow faster than the food supply, he notes, were quickly quashed when scientists realized you can call just about anything a "meat patty." In the face of such irrefutable evidence, Adams decided to base his forecast on something far more reliable than mere trends: the immutable laws of human nature. </p><p> Looking at the future through the prism of human stupidity, selfishness, and horniness, Adams creates a breakthrough portrait of what lies ahead in technology, the workplace, and the viability of various careers and jobs. His vivid, detailed, and highly imaginative (i.e. completely made-up) predictions make it clear that life in the future will be nothing like Star Trek with its transporters, holodecks, phasers, and sex with aliens. In the real world, Adams predicts, there will be a tremendous market for technology that will help workers goof off and still get paid. Among the employee-friendly products he sees on the horizon are the "Excuse 9000," a device which, by introducing appropriate background noises to a phone conversation, will add aural support to any alibi for not being at work, and the "BuzzCut," which will strip the buzz words out of email messages from the boss and retain only what the employee needs to know to remain employed. Employers, of course, will fight back. In the future, Adams asserts, aggressive companies will replace standard cubicles with head cubicles. Designed like a high-tech hairdresser's chair, they will feature an oversized helmet-like device with sensors that will make it easier than ever for managers to monitor the unproductive activities of each employee. </p><p> Obviously, with a work environment like that, many people will choose to work at home. Even today, some are already experiencing the unbridled joy of sitting at home and getting paid for sleeping, eating, watching television, and participating in a couple of less savory activities by adopting the technique known as "telecommuting." Outsourcing -- the shorthand term for allocating work previously done by trusted employees to complete strangers -- is another work-style Adams believes will burgeon in the future. </p><p> Foreseeing a day when "all work will be outsourced until all the work on the planet is being done by one guy," he is confident that the only downside to outsourcing is that one day the guy will call in sick and the entire global economy will plunge into depression. </p><p> Adams identifies many other economic opportunities lurking on the horizon. Working for a big company was a great deal until the downsizing era of the 1990s. Adams predicts that once companies realize they need more than just a CEO and a Director of Diversity, we'll witness the "Revenge of the Downsized." For highly skilled labor, "the job market will start to look like the NBA. Top technical people will command amazingly obscene salaries . . . [there will be] rich superstar professionals on one end of the spectrum; perspiration-wipers on the other. Those who aren't qualified to be either will become managers." </p><p> In certain fields, the future looks bright for even those just starting out. Adams recommends that newcomers consider temping, because no matter what they do (or don't do), it will have no effect on their careers. Accounting, auditing, and dentistry will remain excellent career choices for those who don't like other people but aren't coordinated enough to beat those other people up. And even the most uncoordinated can thrive in the ever-popular area of "getting paid to criticize others." The first step on that ladder may be a job as a newspaper or magazine columnist; the pinnacle will be becoming a publisher or an editor, a position which allows you to criticize not only the people who do the real work, but also the people who criticize those people. </p><p> As Adams succinctly puts it, "It doesn't get any better than that." </p><p> <b>The Dilbert Future</b>, Scott Adams' wry and perhaps prescient take on the future, features the same delightful mix of essays and cartoons found in <b>The Dilbert Principle</b> and <b>Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook</b>, both runaway bestsellers. As millions of readers know, it doesn't get any better than that.</p></p><h2>Living On Sisu: The 1913 Union Copper Strike Tragedy</h2><p>To Twelve-year-old Emma Niemi, life may be hard, but it is basically good. She has finished sixth grade and is nearly a young lady. Her father pushes tram cars full of copper ore in a Calumet and Hecla mine and has saved almost enough money to buy land for a farm. In the summer of 1913, Emma&#39;s life, and the lives of everyone in the region, will be changed forever by a violent strike against the mining companies of Houghton and Keweenaw Counties of Michigan&#39;s Upper Peninsula. A friend whose father is not on strike will be forbidden to talk to her. Another will die in the terrible Italian Hall Tragedy on Christmas Eve. Only the character trait the Finnish people call &#34;sisu&#34; will help her and others in the region live through this terrible tragedy.</p><p>Deborah Frontiera, who grew up in Michigan&#x2019;s Upper Peninsula, has lived in Houston, TX since 1985, and taught in public schools until 2008.

Frontiera has done an excellent job exploring the history of the strike through Emma s diary which follows all the key events and issues in the strike, including the false call of fire which caused the death of seventy three, primarily children, of those attending a Christmas Eve party for strikers families. I enjoyed reading the novel which, like many other fine pieces of children s literature (being a first place winner in 2010 in historical fiction of the prestigious Purple Dragonfly Awards for children s books), is able to transcend its chosen age group to be an interesting read for any who pick the book up. I think that the issues in the strike were treated respectfully and that the author was able to create a nuanced tale with a variety of very engaging characters.

In this intricately crafted history, Tamara Venit Shelton chronicles the dynamic systems of knowledge, therapies, and <i>materia medica</i> crossing between China and the United States from the eighteenth century to the present. Chinese medicine, she argues, has played an important and often unacknowledged role in both facilitating and undermining the consolidation of medical authority among formally trained biomedical scientists in the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> Practitioners of Chinese medicine, as racial embodiments of &#x201c;irregular&#x201d; medicine, became useful foils for Western physicians struggling to assert their superiority of practice. At the same time, Chinese doctors often embraced and successfully employed Orientalist stereotypes to sell their services to non-Chinese patients skeptical of modern biomedicine. What results is a story of racial constructions, immigration politics, cross-cultural medical history, and the lived experiences of Asian Americans in American history.</p><p><b>Tamara Venit Shelton</b> is associate professor of history at Claremont McKenna College and author of <i>A Squatter&#x2019;s Republic: Land and the Politics of Monopoly in California, 1850&#x2013;1900</i><i>.</i>&#x201c;Fascinating, innovative, and well written. <i>Herbs and Roots </i>provides a comprehensive study of Chinese medicine and its practitioners in the United States, giving us new insights into both race relations and the history of medicine in general.&#x201d;&#x2014;Bridie Andrews, author of<i> The Making of Modern Chinese Medicine, 1850-1960</i><br>"From a treasure trove of primary sources,Tamara Venit Shelton has crafted an important and original contribution to immigration history, medical and health history, and Asian American history.&#x201d;&#x2014;Nancy Tomes, author of&nbsp;<i>Remaking the American Patient</i><br><i>"Herbs and Roots </i>is a captivating historical account of the development of Chinese medicine in the United States&#x2014;an interesting read with a fine balance of academic rigor and storytelling."&#x2014;Ka-Kit Hui, MD, FACP Center for East-West Medicine and Center for Collaborative Centers for Integrative Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles<br>&#x201c;Readers will relish this gracefully written volume&#x2019;s rich contribution to the history of immigration, American medicine,&nbsp;and the trans-Pacific journey of traditional Chinese therapeutics.&#x201d;&#x2014;Alan&nbsp;Kraut,&nbsp;author of <i>Silent Travelers:&nbsp;Germs, Genes, and the "Immigrant Menace"</i><br>&#x201c;<i>Herbs and Roots </i>fills a gap in the current historical scholarship on the cultural history of Chinese medicine as actually practiced in Chinese communities in America&#x201d;&#x2014;William C.

Raesinia said.<br><br> "Nearly, Your Highness," said the royal dressmaker, a plump, red-faced woman who towered over her diminutive monarch. "One more, if you please. Take a breath and hold it."<br><br> Raesinia complied, and the dressmaker whipped a knotted cord around her middle with expert speed. She muttered to herself and tugged it a bit tighter, then looked.<br><br> "Wonderful. Thank you, Your Highness. I must say you are very lucky to have such a slender frame. And such beautiful skin! You will look magnificent."<br><br> Raesinia caught her own gaze in the mirror over the dressmaker's shoulder and rolled her eyes. Stripped down to her underthings, she could see the truth clearly enough. I look like a child. And she always would.<br><br> Her unaging state could be inconvenient, but her actual appearance had never really bothered her. It could be useful even-with the right outfit, she could pass for a boy, and political opponents had a persistent tendency to underestimate her. She'd never particularly wanted male attention, though it had occasionally come her way regardless. Poor Ben, who tried to protect me and died for it. Now, though . . .<br><br> "One in sea green, I think," the dressmaker was saying. "And one in that lovely Hamveltai crimson. I know just the supplier. And then-"<br><br> "I leave it entirely in your hands," Raesinia said. "But you must excuse me. There's a great deal of business to attend to."<br><br> That was wrong, she realized at once. A queen didn't ask a servant to excuse her. I should tell her to go. But politeness had been ground into Raesinia since her earliest education, and now that she was back in the palace, all the old lessons had resurfaced.<br><br> "Of course." The dressmaker bowed deeply. "I am honored by your custom, Your Highness."<br><br> Joanna opened the door. The large, silent woman and her slim, more talkative partner, Barely, were on permanent detachment from the Girls' Own as Raesinia's personal guards. Their presence had already become a comforting part of her landscape, and it was hard to imagine that she'd once been without them. They'd been part of the group that rescued her from the Penitent Damned and Maurisk's Directory, and they'd stayed at her side through the horrors of the Murnskai campaign. While Joanna was resplendent in a well-tailored blue-and-silver dress uniform, Raesinia had no doubt that the sword and pistol on her belt were extremely functional. Even with Vordan more or less at peace, it was a comforting thought.<br><br> "Tell Barely to send the girls in, please," Raesinia said.<br><br> Joanna nodded and leaned out the door. She never spoke, but she and her partner had a private language of hand signals that let her make herself understood. Raesinia was resolved to learn it herself someday. When I have time.<br><br> Someday I'll have all the time in the world.<br><br> Two young women in palace livery swept in and went to work, silent and efficient. Raesinia stood stock-still, raising or lowering her arms as required, feeling a bit like an articulated dummy. On campaign with the army, she'd mostly gotten away with reasonably practical riding outfits, and before that she'd still been in official mourning for her father. Now, though, with the echoes of the victory celebrations still fading from the palace and life returning to something like normal, standards had to be maintained. Or so said Mistress Lagovil, the intimidating head of the palace staff, and Raesinia hadn't yet worked up the nerve to argue with her.<br><br> One of those standards, apparently, was that the queen couldn't be seen in any outfit that she could possibly don under her own power. Raesinia had pushed for a little practicality-she did have work to do, whatever Mistress Lagovil might say-but that still meant yards of lace and silk, carefully matched with rings, bracelets, combs, necklaces, and whatever else could be scrounged from the Royal Jewelhouse. To Raesinia's eyes the final effect was, at best, "sparkly." She'd been raised to appreciate palace fashion, but the lessons had never really sunk in.<br><br> Mistress Lagovil had apologized for the sorry state of the wardrobe, and indeed the rest of Ohnlei. The palace had been sacked once by the revolution and again when Janus' army had been quartered there. Furniture had been broken up for firewood and drapes torn apart for uniforms and bandages. Much of the staff was gone, fled or drafted into the army, and only a handful had returned despite the end of the war. The nobles who'd once lent their splendor to the court were still mostly hunkered down at their country estates, waiting to be sure the storm had well and truly passed, and Raesinia couldn't say she blamed them.<br><br> At least some of the more tedious rituals had been temporarily suspended. Raesinia could take her meals in her quarters-the Grand Hall had been used to stable cavalry mounts and was still being cleaned out-and there were few dignitaries who required official receptions. No one suggested going hunting. Privately, Raesinia dreaded the day the full splendor of the palace was restored. Before her father's death, her days had been as tightly regulated as a clockmaker's apprentice, jammed with lessons, formal dinners, court outings, and other official occasions.<br><br> Once she was dressed, Raesinia took a few tentative steps in front of the mirror, to confirm that she could walk without anything falling off. It wasn't a bad dress, really, a deep Vordanai blue accented with silver, flattering to a figure that didn't have much to flatter. Raesinia rolled her eyes at herself again, signaled her approval to the maids, and followed them out into her private chambers.<br><br> Eric was waiting for her, practically vibrating with nerves, and Raesinia stifled a sigh. It really wasn't his fault, as he'd been thrust into a job he'd had no preparation for-he'd been a clerk doing the palace accounts until Raesinia had asked Mistress Lagovil for an assistant, and he was still overawed by the royal presence. He was competent enough, but . . .<br><br> No but. It's not his fault that he's not Sothe. Every time she saw Eric's too-serious face, struggling to maintain the constipated expression he associated with proper dignity, Raesinia missed her old maidservant. Maidservant, bodyguard, spy, assassin. Friend. She'd left, after thwarting Orlanko's assassins on the final night of the Murnskai campaign. Where are you, Sothe?<br><br> "Your Highness," Eric said. "You look lovely. And the dressmaker has given me her assurances that everything will be ready before-"<br><br> Raesinia waved a hand. "I'm sure she'll do fine. What do we have today?"<br><br> Eric looked down at the leather notebook he always carried. "The Duke of Brookspring is expecting you in twenty minutes, Your Highness. Then lunch with Mistress Cora, and you agreed to grant an audience to Deputy d'Andorre."<br><br> See? I do have work to do. Even if it sometimes seemed like everyone wanted her to sit back and ignore it. "We'd better get started, then."<br><br> The old Borelgai embassy, a rambling, ancient stone pile at the edge of the palace grounds, had been burned by a mob during the revolution. For now the Borelgai ambassador and his staff had been assigned to a suite in the palace itself. Eric led the way there, through corridors largely deserted except for guards at regular intervals. The soldiers-part of the First Division had the honor today, Raesinia saw-came smartly to attention as she passed. Joanna and Barely, her constant shadows, followed a few steps behind her.<br><br> "Did Dorsay say why he wanted to see me?" Raesinia said.<br><br> "His Grace did not mention a specific reason," Eric said. "As far as I'm aware, the treaty is progressing well, if slowly."<br><br> That was Dorsay's ostensible reason for being in Vordan, the peace treaty that would officially end the war between their two countries. There were a great many details to be ironed out, and in practice the negotiations were conducted between a swarm of bureaucrats from both sides. Trying to understand the actual points of contention made Raesinia's head hurt, but she did her best to keep abreast of the general shape of things. Dorsay didn't even seem to do that, happy to let his underlings do the work. Raesinia suspected he was here more as a reminder than anything else, Borel's greatest living soldier showing the flag to underline the fact that-unlike all her other opponents-Vordan hadn't beaten the Borelgai in open battle.<br><br> Two Borelgai Life Guards, their shakos lined with their trademark white fur, stood guard outside the door to the embassy suite. They came to attention as well, and the door opened to reveal the perpetual smile of Ihannes Pulwer-Monsangton, Borel's ambassador to Vordan. If Dorsay was all bluff informality, which Raesinia had come to respect during their time in Murnsk, Ihannes was the opposite, with the oily charm of the professional diplomat. Raesinia presented him with her own best smile and acknowledged his slight bow with a nod.<br><br> "Your Highness," he said. "You honor us."<br><br> "Ambassador." Raesinia paused when Ihannes didn't move aside.<br><br> His smile turned apologetic. "His Grace has asked that this be a private meeting."<br><br> "Of course." Raesinia gestured for Joanna and Barely to wait. "Eric, find me after my meeting with Mistress Cora."<br><br> Ihannes stepped aside, and Raesinia swept past him. The Borelgai suite was elaborately furnished, by the standards of the depleted palace, with furniture and decorations in the severe Borelgai style. More diplomatic posturing, she assumed.<br><br> Attua Dorsay, the Duke of Brookspring, was seated at the head of the long table, vigorously applying butter and jam to several slices of toast. Ihannes cleared his throat theatrically, and Dorsay looked up.<br><br> "You getting a cough, Ihannes?" he said. The twinkle in his eye made Raesinia certain he was needling the ambassador.<br><br> "No, Your Grace." Ihannes stepped aside. "The queen is here."<br><br> "I can see that," Dorsay said. He gestured at his plate. "Care for any breakfast, Your Highness?"<br><br> "No, thank you," Raesinia said, barely restraining a smile at Ihannes' pained expression.<br><br> "Sit down, then. That'll be all, Ihannes."<br><br> "Your Grace?" The ambassador's brow furrowed.<br><br> "I mean take yourself somewhere else," Dorsay said. "I told you I wanted this to be a private meeting."<br><br> Ihannes' expression went even frostier, but he bowed silently and left through an inner door. Dorsay resumed buttering his toast, which was already dripping.<br><br> "Butter," he said without much preamble. "You people have always been good at it."<br><br> "Thank you, Your Grace," Raesinia said cautiously.<br><br> "Butter, cream, cheese, and so on. All in short supply back home, since the war started. Do you know how much of our cheese comes from Vordan?" Before she could answer, he waved a hand. "I didn't, and neither did Georg. Nobody thinks about these things before they start a war."<br><br> Georg referred to Georg Pulwer, the King of Borel, with whom Dorsay was apparently on a first-name basis. Raesinia wasn't sure how much of that was bluster and how much was truth. It was always hard to tell with Dorsay.<br><br> "It was you who put us under blockade," Raesinia said, keeping her tone light. "If it were up to me, His Majesty could have all the cheese he could eat."<br><br> "Which is a shockingly large amount, I can attest." Dorsay crunched into the toast, getting flecks of butter in his bristly mustache. He sat back and sighed with pleasure. "Hells. No beating the real stuff. Back home they try to make something with goat's milk, if you can believe that. Goat's milk! Ha."<br><br> "Once the treaty is finished, I'll send a few casks with you, as a going-away present."<br><br> "A small price to pay to be rid of me!" Dorsay cackled. "No doubt you'll throw a party to celebrate."<br><br> "You'll always be welcome at my court," Raesinia said. "You helped me keep the peace when we might as easily have been at each other's throats."<br><br> "And your man d'Ivoire saved my neck from that snake Orlanko," Dorsay said. "I won't forget it, believe me." He finished the toast, wiped his face on a napkin, and turned to look up at her. His famous nose, long and curved, stuck out like the prow of a ship. "That's the spirit in which I asked you here, in fact. Nothing to do with the treaty. Wanted to pass on a bit of private information."<br><br> "Oh?" Raesinia hesitated for moment, then pulled a heavy wooden chair from the table and settled herself facing Dorsay. "Information is always appreciated."<br><br> "How much are you hearing out of Murnsk?"<br><br> "Not a great deal," Raesinia admitted. "They withdrew their ambassador when the war started, and we haven't received any official response to our inquiries since. The Army of the North has pulled back over the border into Vordan."<br><br> "I suspected as much. Our forces have pulled out as well, but Borel has significant commercial interest in western Murnsk, and sometimes they pass tidbits along."<br><br> Raesinia nodded. Once again, she missed Sothe. Vordan's intelligence service had been largely dismantled in the wake of Orlanko's rebellion, but Sothe had a knack for acquiring information. Raesinia had tasked Alek Giforte with creating something to fill the void left by the Concordat, but that project was still in its infancy.<br><br> "Western Murnsk is in chaos," Dorsay went on. "To put it mildly. The bizarre weather has wreaked havoc, and to make matters worse, the northern savages have crossed the Bataria in strength, raiding and burning as they go. I imagine you saw some of that for yourself."<br><br> "I did indeed," Raesinia said. Dorsay didn't know that neither event was a coincidence-the summer had turned freezing under the magical influence of the Black Priests, and the Trans-Batariai tribes had come in response to Elysium's call to defeat the approaching Vordanai army. "What is the emperor doing about it?"<br><br> "Not a great deal, and that's the part that's odd. There are some strange rumors coming out of Mohkba. Some people are saying the emperor's dead, and others insist that Prince Cesha Dzurk is a traitor and is lying about it to seize the throne."<br><br> "Janus smashed at least two sizable Murnskai armies on his way north," Raesinia said. "We heard that the crown prince was killed in the fighting. It wouldn't be a surprise if all that caused some upheaval." She shook her head. "If the harvest was ruined, the whole region must be facing famine. Perhaps we should organize some kind of aid."<br><br> "It's not usually the winners of a war who offer help to the losers," Dorsay said, eyes twinkling.<br><br> "We were never at war with the people of Murnsk," Raesinia said. "Our quarrel was with Elysium. And the emperor, once he set himself against us."<br><br> "Elysium is the crux of it," Dorsay said. "Something very strange has happened there. As best we can tell, much of the Church administration has decamped, legging it for Mohkba and points east as fast as their mules will carry them. No one has gotten close enough to Elysium to find out what's happening there in weeks. People who try just . . ." He waved his hands. "Vanish."</p><h2>Nurturing the Nations: Reclaiming the Dignity of Women in Building Healthy Cultures</h2><p>Our world is filled with nations that are impoverished largely because half of their people&#x2014;the female population&#x2014;are disenfranchised. But this is not just a book about women; it is a book that deals with the intersection of three seemingly very different subjects: women, poverty and world view. <br> <br> Nurturing the Nations explains how the ideas that societies embrace create healthy or impoverished cultures and supports that theory with information regarding domestic violence, murder and pornography. The book addresses one of the greatest causes of worldwide poverty, the lie that men are superior to women. In noting that the world view of a culture frames how it understands women and men, various paradigms are studied, such as Hinduism and Animism, showing how they lead to the abuse and hatred of women.<br> <br> This topic cannot be addressed without studying the Trinity as a model for male-female relationships. Servanthood, submission and the transcendence of sexuality are all discussed based on the idea that male and female were created equal in being but different in function. The book concludes with a look at the history of women in the Old and New Testament&#x2014;how they were established as the co-laborers of men in the development of creation and the liberating challenge Jesus issued to the sexist culture of his day.<br> <br> Nurturing the Nations is for Christians who are interested in the issue of poverty; missionaries; relief and development workers; and Christians who are working with poor and abused women.</p><p>Darrow Miller serves as vice president of Food for the Hungry International and co-founder of the Disciple Nations Alliance. For over twenty-five years, Darrow has spoken at conferences and seminars on topics that include world view and poverty, world view and development, the Christian movement worldwide, Christianity and culture, Christian apologetics and social issues.

The Elevators followed their own spiritual cosmic agenda, to change society by finding a new path to enlightenment. Their battles with repressive authorities in Texas and their escape to San Francisco&#x2019;s embryonic counterculture are legendary.</p><p>When the Elevators returned to Texas, the band became subject to investigation by Austin police. Lead singer Roky Erickson was forced into a real-life enactment of <i>One Flew over the Cuckoo&#x2019;s Nest</i> and was put away in a maximum-security unit for the criminally insane for years. Tommy Hall, their Svengali lyricist, lived in a cave. Guitarist Stacy Sutherland was imprisoned. The drummer was involuntarily subjected to electric shock treatments, and the bassist was drafted into the Vietnam War.</p><p>This fascinating biography breaks decades of silence of band members and addresses a huge cult following of Elevators fans in the United States and Europe.

IP.</p><p>Much Irish history is written as a matter of heroes and leaders, of great personalities and sweeping events. T. W. Moody and F. X. Martin&#39;s collection of essays by leading historians offers all those things, but it takes the land itself as its starting point. Ireland, they write, has always been poor because of its ungiving soil; always isolated because of its ring of imposing mountains and steep hills--but always open to invasion from the east across the calm, narrow Irish Sea, because of which, they write, &#34;our present-day laws and institutions have their origins in England.&#34; While taking a long view of events, they manage to compress thousands of years of history into this fact-filled, highly readable book.The late T.W. Moody (1907 - 1984) was, for many years, professor of modern history at Trinity College, Dublin. F.X. Martin (1923 - 2000) was Emeritus Professor of Medieval History, University College, Dublin.</p><h2>CALCULUS-AP EDITION,ENHANCED (HS)</h2><p>It is brand-new</p><p></p><h2>Popular Mechanics Workshop: Band Saw Fundamentals: The Complete Guide</h2><p><p>Woodworkers trust <i>Popular Mechanics</i> to give them the information they need&#x2014;and the <i>Workshop</i> series, written by respected DIY author Rick Peters, has proven especially invaluable.

Combining elements of classic McElroy with tantalizing stories pointing the way ahead (the spare and dangerous "No Man's Land," the lush and mischievous "The Campaign Trail"), "Night Soul and Other Stories" presents a wide range of work from a monumental artist.</p></p><p>Joseph McElroy was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1930. He is the author of nine novels and has written dozens of stories, essays, and reviews. He has received the Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and fellowships from the Guggenheim, Rockefeller, and Ingram Merrill Foundations, as well as the National Endowment for the Arts.McElroy, known for his lengthy, complex novels, writes equally complex short stories. The subjects of those in this collection cover a broad range, including immigrant life in Brooklyn, architecture from the point of view of a cutting-edge practitioner, acupuncture, modern art, biochemistry, ethical behavior, and physics. And while including the subject matter of his obsessions, McElroy describes situations plaguing human nature, such as the disillusionment of children, betrayal of trust, and dissolution of a long-term marriage, and also includes the ironies of constructive thoughts and intentions gone wrong. McElroy writes discursive, oddly punctuated, paragraph-length sentences. Although this style can be difficult for readers to master, the rewards are great. His plots mosey over many topics and fascinate with the knowledge of science, the arts, and city and country life displayed. Amusement at the vicissitudes of human life peppers situations with a wry humor. Public libraries with readers of postmodern literature will want this volume for fiction collections. It will increase interest in McElroy&#x2019;s writing and attract readers to his longer works. --Ellen Loughran</p><h2>The Big Open: On Foot Across Tibet&#39;s Chang Tang</h2><p>On foot and on their own, four adventurers brave the challenges of nature on a 275-mile trek through one of the most beautiful&#x2014;and most remote&#x2014;regions of the world.</p><p><b>Rick Ridgeway</b>&nbsp;is a mountaineer, writer, and businessman who currently serves as Patagonia&#x2019;s vice president of environmental affairs. His books include <i>The Shadow of Kilimanjaro: On Foot across East Africa</i>,<i> The Big Open: On Foot across Tibet&#x2019;s Chang Tang</i>, and <i>The Last Step: The American Ascent of K2</i>, an account of his experience as one of the first Americans to climb the second-highest mountain in the world.<br><br><b>Galen Rowell</b> (1940&#x2013;2002) was an internationally celebrated photographer, mountaineer, and author.&nbsp;The recipient of an Ansel Adams Award for Conservation Photography, he was a respected writer with 18 books and numerous magazine articles to his name.&nbsp;His work was frequently featured in&nbsp;<i>National Geographic</i>,&nbsp;<i>Life</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sports Illustrated</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Outside</i>.<br><br><b>Conrad Anker</b> is a world-renowned mountaineer who has summited Everest three times and climbed many of the other challenging heights around the world. Best known for having discovered the body of early twentieth-century adventurer George Mallory on Everest in 1999, Anker is captain of the North Face Athlete Team and continues to inspire with his climbing prowess and his thoughtful dedication to the people of the Himalaya. He is the author of <i>The Lost Explorer</i>, about finding Mallory, and the primary coauthor of National Geographic's <i>The Call of Everest</i>.Adventure writer Ridgeway (The Shadow of Kilimanjaro) crafts an urgent, poetic narrative as he guides readers across Tibet&#x2019;s barren and treacherous northern plateau in search of the calving grounds of the chiru, an endangered antelope. Along with his three companions-late nature photographer Galen Rowell, Conrad Anker, who wrote the foreword, and Jimmy Chin-the seasoned mountaineer traces the female chiru&#x2019;s 200-mile migration route. The bulk of the story focuses on the Chang Tang&#x2019;s natural splendor and the adverse conditions the group faced while lugging 200 pounds of food, water and photographic equipment on aluminum rickshaws at soaring altitudes. "To conserve batteries," Ridgeway writes, "everyone but Conrad turns off their headlamps. In the east a fingernail of moon glows through a reef of clouds. We are traveling at a compass bearing of 30 degrees, and I assume that Conrad, like me, is using the stars in the sky to maintain our course." But Ridgeway also offers a thoughtful regional history and an affecting description of the complex human struggle surrounding the rampant poaching of chiru and the illegal trade in their pelts (their fur is woven into shahtoosh, an ultrafine and precious wool). The group&#x2019;s mission is ultimately successful: the Chinese government plans to create a national preserve based on their discovery. The international effort to save the Tibetan antelope and the "big open" steppe it inhabits elevates the narrative beyond the usual extreme travel tour to an enthralling and hopeful height.

Ferguson&#x2019;s</b> <b>Introduction to<i> The Federalist</i>&nbsp;</b></p><p>The greatest American contribution to world literature has come through the country&#x2019;s originating claims. Between 1776 and 1820, the most intense philosophical period of civic discourse ever known, a literature of public documents dominates intellectual creativity in the United States. It consists of pamphlets, orations, declarations, ordinances of expansion, bills of rights, petitions of toleration, constitutions of all kinds, and a handful of judicial opinions. The best of these works reach for national identity through claims of universal rights and faith in the dignity of humankind. The words they contain are the aspirations that have attracted so many to American shores. More concretely, the same writings create representative government as we know it and a continental republicanism previously unimaginable. The obvious capstones of this literature are the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the Constitution of the United States in 1787, official texts honored throughout the world. Not far behind them, however, and a commentary on both, comes a collaboration of essays known as <i>The Federalist</i>. Printed first as ephemeral newspaper articles amid factional clamor but then as a two-volume book, it stands alone today as a practical guide to political theory and a sourcebook of civic understanding. </p><p>Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay were the three very different and mostly separate authors of the eighty-five papers that make up <i>The Federalist</i>. They proceeded under a general plan set by Hamilton, but they worked independently on individual assignments. The loose partnership would last ten months, from October 27, 1787, until August 16, 1788, and when it was done, it, better than any other writing of the time, would come closest<b> </b>to articulating what the new and struggling United States might become. <i>The Federalist</i> took its direction and tone from the most vital dispute in American history. At issue was acceptance or rejection of the newly proposed Federal Constitution of 1787, and the debate over it was an acrimonious one. Citizens were being forced to make a choice between radically different conceptions of their country at a time when few observers could predict with confidence that the states would survive for long as one nation.</p><p>We forget how controversial the Constitution was in the moment of its birth. The document that now governs the United States was drafted in secrecy by men who knew that they had acted beyond the mandate given to them. Sent as state delegates to Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 to discuss problems in the new union, they had been told to make any adjustments <i>within</i> the Articles of Confederation as the official compact of union. The Articles had been drafted in the anti-authoritarian moment and spirit of 1776. It was a companion document to the Declaration of Independence, and it left autonomy in the hands of the individual states. Nonetheless, five years would pass before the apprehensive states approved even this loose coalition, and they did so in 1781 only after many revisions by Revolutionary leaders who feared centralized authority. The framers of the Constitution in Philadelphia basically ignored these fears. Instead of tinkering with the arrangement, they junked the Articles of Confederation altogether and wrote out their own document of fundamental principles. When they were done, they had substituted a much stronger ideal of union than the suspicious compromisers of the original Confederation had contemplated or would have allowed. </p><p>Nor was that all. When the framers in Philadelphia made their document public on September 17, 1787, after four long months of closed deliberation, they tacked on a string of non-negotiable demands. They insisted that their document, the new Constitution, be submitted unchanged by Confederation authorities to the states for ratification, that it be approved through state conventions for that purposee rather than through the existing state legislatures, that ratification require only a strong majority of the states rather than the unanimity stipulated under the original compact, and that their own deliberations remain secret and inviolable during debate over the document that they had written. Finally, the framers resisted any reconsideration by a comparable deliberative body of the kind that they had just conducted among themselves. When asked toward the end of the<b> </b>Convention about possible amendments through another general conclave because &#x201c;it was improper to say to the people, take this or nothing,&#x201d; Charles Pinckney answered for all of the framers when he replied, &#x201c;Conventions are serious things, and ought not to be repeated.&#x201d;</p><p>The early responses to the framers&#x2019; proposals ranged from uncertainty to outrage. If the Constitution was to be accepted, clearly much would have to be explained and quickly. The essays that make up <i>The Federalist</i> sought to be that explanation. They began to appear almost immediately. The first two anonymous newspaper essays were in print the month after the Constitution became public. <i>The Federalist</i>, in this sense, must be read as a partisan response to the anxiety that most early republicans felt as they tried to absorb the altered plan of union offered to them. The initial articles were treated, in fact, as political bluster for the popular press. When they continued to appear and accumulate, they won another dubious distinction: The eighty-five assembled papers would be the most protracted and prolix pamphlet series Americans had seen in an age of obsessive pamphleteering. Beleaguered opponents dubbed them the most tiresome production they had ever encountered. Supporters, of course, found higher qualities; a few even saw what the essays would become. When Thomas Jefferson, ambassador to France, read his own copy of <i>The Federalist</i> in Paris in late 1788, he called it &#x201c;the best commentary on the principles of government, which ever was written,&#x201d; a claim that holds up well today. There is no other book in constitutional thought in any language quite like <i>The Federalist</i> for its careful and thorough blend of range, penetration, principle, structure, and practical implication.</p></p><h2>Hidden Riches</h2><p>After purchasing an odd assortment of auction items, a Philadelphia antiques dealer becomes the deadly focus of a sinister international smuggler, and she and her handsome upstairs tenant, an ex-cop, set out to uncover the truth</p><p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Centennial Award for 100th published novel.The faint cry of her neighbor's new baby was barely audible from where bounty hunter Cat Dupree was sitting in her apartment, and yet, for some reason, it was all she could hear. She'd blocked out the thunder of her own heartbeat and was ignoring the sick, helpless feeling that had taken root in the pit of her stomach. Her entire focus was on the wanted posters plastered over the walls of her office&#x2014;that and the baby's continuous wail.<p>Her laptop was sitting on top of a file cabinet by the door. The GPS program that was running showed a map of Mexico and a blip that, for the past thirty-six hours, had continued to move steadily westward. It was her worst nightmare come to life, yet she chose to ignore it for the faces on the wanted posters.</p><p>After all these years, the faces were as familiar to her as her own, and yet none of them matched the face of the man who, since childhood, had haunted her dreams. The man who had killed her father and left a six-inch scar along the base of her throat. The same man she'd seen only a few weeks ago and had been certain&#x2014;so certain&#x2014;was finally dead. She glanced back at the laptop and winced. Now she wasn't so sure.</p><p>Wind rattled the windowpanes behind her, signaling the oncoming storm heading for Dallas. Rain was imminent, but the temperature was in the high thirties, which meant no accompanying ice or snow. After the ice storm they'd endured during Christmas, a simple rainstorm was welcome news. As the wind gusted again, she shivered, then folded her arms across her chest and hunched her shoulders, thankful for the central heating in her apartment. As she did, her focus shifted to the wanted poster tacked above the doorway.</p><p>The poster of Justin "Mad Dog" Bailey was the first she'd hung more than fifteen years ago. He'd been singled out as worthy of posting for the simple fact that he had tattoos all over his face and body, one of the identifying features of her father's killer. She'd known immediately that he wasn't the man she was looking for, but she'd had to start somewhere, so she'd tacked him up. She tunneled her fingers through her hair. Her head ached, and the muscles in her neck and back were miserably tight, but that was of no importance to her. It was revenge that had driven her to where she was in life, and it was revenge she needed. Her gaze slid to the next poster.</p><p>Edward John Forrest. Edward was too young to have committed the attack on her family, but she'd felt compelled to hang his booking photos anyway, and so it had begun. Over the years, she'd acquired an impressive collection.</p><p>As she stood, she realized the neighbor's baby had quit crying. Either someone had poked a bottle in its mouth, or it had finally given up and fallen asleep. The silence was oddly uncomfortable. Now there was nothing to sidetrack her awareness of that damned laptop and the map on its screen.</p><p>Frustrated by her lack of willpower, Cat glanced up again, squinting slightly as the light glared on the monitor, blurring the geography through which the blip continued to move. Even though she couldn't see it clearly, she knew it well.</p><p>It was Mexico&#x2014;the place where she'd run her best friend's killer to ground.</p><p>She glanced back at the wanted posters all over her office walls. After Mexico, they were redundant, because there she'd come face-to-face with not only the man who'd killed her friend Marsha, but the tattooed man she'd spent half her life looking for. His name was Solomon Tutuola, and while, for the third time in her life, she had unexpectedly lived to see another day, she had been under the assumption that Tutuola had not. Then this damned blip had resurfaced, taunting her with the possibility that her assumption had been wrong.</p><p>Feeling defeated, she moved slowly toward the doorway, then paused under Mad Dog's poster and reached up. The paper crackled as she slipped a fingernail beneath the edge. For some reason she hesitated, discovering it was more difficult to remove than it had been to put up.</p><p>Finally she pulled it down and dropped it into the trash, then reached for another one. One by one, she pulled them down, until the walls were completely bare and the trash can was full to overflowing. She emptied it, then began dumping the stacks of posters on the floor into another bag.</p><p>Almost an hour passed before the task was finished, and then she finally allowed herself another look at the laptop. The blip was motionless. Whoever was carrying the bugged property that was showing hot on the laptop had stopped for the night.</p><p>She grimaced. The bastard was getting more rest than she was. Frustrated, she looked back at the filled trash bags littering the floor and sighed. Those images had been such a part of her life, it seemed strange that she didn't need them anymore.</p><p>Last month she'd finally put a name to the face of the man who'd killed her father.</p><p>Last month she'd watched the house he'd been in blow up and then burn.</p><p>Last month she'd been certain he was dead.</p><p>Now she wasn't so sure.</p><p>The motionless blip was like a taunt&#x2014;a "come and find me if you can" dare that she couldn't ignore.</p><p>Cat sighed. It was time to see if the devil was dead, or if&#x2014;as she feared&#x2014;he'd resurrected himself. But before she absented herself from Dallas again, she had to tell her boss, Art Ball. Just because she had an agenda, that didn't mean he could put his bail-bond business on hold for her. There would always be bail jumpers to find. She just wasn't going to be the one doing it for him&#x2014;at least not for a while.</p><p>And then there was Wilson McKay. She wasn't sure what she was going to do about him. She refused to admit that he deserved any kind of explanation of what she was up to. Just because they'd had sex&#x2014; unbelievable sex&#x2014;didn't mean she owed him anything. And just because he'd helped her bring in Mark Presley, the man who'd killed Marsha Benton, that didn't mean she had to keep him updated on the rest of her life.</p><p>Part of her wanted to blame Wilson for this uncertainty. When the house where Presley and Tutuola had been hiding out down in Mexico caught on fire, she'd captured Presley, then wanted to go back to make sure Tutuola was dead.</p><p>But Wilson had stopped her.</p><p>The fact that she would most likely have died if she'd gone back into the burning house was beside the point. When she was being honest with herself, she knew there was no one to blame. But she couldn't live with herself until she knew for sure if her father's killer had survived.</p><p>Tomorrow she would call Art and then head south to the border. She had to know who was behind that blip. If it was some Mexican local who'd come across some of Mark Presley's bugged property, then so be it. But if it was Tutuola, then her job still wasn't done. As much as she dreaded another long road trip, she was satisfied with her decision. Within moments, Cat walked out of her office and headed for her bedroom to pack.</p><p>It had been almost a week since Wilson McKay had seen Cat. When he was rational, he told himself to just let her go. It was obvious she didn't want anything from him except the occasional round of sex. He should have been happy to just take what she gave out with a thank you and a pat on her butt. Any other woman and he would have. But not her. She'd gotten under his skin in a way no other woman had done and, despite everything he believed in and every instinct he had that told him to let her go, he just couldn't&#x2014;which explained why he was on his way to her apartment unannounced, with a pizza and a six-pack of beer.</p><p>Traffic was heavy on the bypass, but nothing out of the ordinary for Dallas on a rainy Saturday night. The smell of pepperoni wafted under Wilson's nose as he took the exit leading to Cat's apartment building, while the constant sweep of windshield wipers kept the view clear. His radio was tuned to a country station&#x2014;its style matched his mood and the dark and stormy weather. He needed a Cat fix&#x2014;at the least, a long session of kissing and cuddling, at the most, a long night with the wildcat in his arms. Just the thought of how it felt to bury himself deep inside her made him ache with want. She was a handful between the sheets, always giving back as good as she got. He had yet to understand how a woman with that much passion in bed managed to stay so cold and distant from everyone she knew. He suspected it had to do with all she'd endured at such a young age, and because of that, he just wasn't willing to give up on her&#x2014;yet.</p><p>The glow of headlights from the heavy flow of traffic was refracted by the rain, while the constant swish of wipers gave the night streets a garish appearance. Wilson thought of the comfort waiting for him inside Cat's cozy apartment and refused to consider the fact that her welcome might not be as warm.</p><p>When he pulled into the parking lot and circled her building in search of a space, he couldn't help but notice that the lights were on in her apartment. Now it came down to the crunch. She was home, but would she welcome him in or send him packing with a sharp word and a glare from her cold, blue eyes?</p><p>He parked, grabbed the pizza and beer, and headed for the door. He would know soon enough how warm his welcome would be.</p><p>Cat was on her hands and knees in the back of her closet, searching for the matching boot to the one already sitting next to her suitcase, when she thought she heard the doorbell ring. Frowning, she rocked back on her heels and listened again.</p><p>There!</p><p>This time she heard the chimes clearly and frowned. "Who in the&#x2014;"</p><p>Wilson. She knew without a doubt that it was Wilson McKay. He was the only person who visited her and the only one she knew who would come without calling. Probably because he figured she wouldn't answer the door if she knew he was coming, and she almost didn't answer it now. Despite her instincts telling her to leave him standing there, she headed for the living room, hating herself for the spurt of excitement she was feeling. She didn't really have time for this, but ignoring him might raise more suspicion than if she just let him in and got it over with. At least, that was what she was ...</p></p><h2>The Story of Graphic Design: From the Invention of Writing to the Birth of Digital Design</h2><p>This&nbsp;comprehensive illustrated history begins with&nbsp;the origins of the alphabet itself and carries the reader&nbsp;through the first handwritten books, the invention of printing in the Renaissance, the explosion of graphic styles (and printed media) in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the impact of digital technology on design today.Like E.H.

The granite blocks of Fairbridge, the leaden sky, the misty rain, the straight stone walls bisecting fields. Even the steel of Father&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br>Scotland wasn&#x2019;t all gray, of course. In summer, the hills of Perthshire were muted green, in the spring flecked with the yellow-brown of gorse, and in the autumn, brown. But washed over all of it, gray. It was the color I knew best.<br><br>Lately, though, I saw more black than anything. It was draped on our front doorknob, it edged my handkerchiefs, it hung in my wardrobe in a modest row of new dresses. Six weeks of mourning black. Six weeks of sympathetic looks, of waxy pale lilies, of whispered conversations about what was to be done with me. But then Madame Cr�pet swept into the house, smelling of violets in a dress the color of honeycomb, and set about straightening things. The household was too happy to leave me in her hands. They didn&#x2019;t know what to do with me anyway. As soon as Madame had my new black dresses packed up, we left for France.<br><br>Right away, France was too bright. From the blue-green of the Channel lapping the edges of Calais, past orange-roofed houses and yellow rapeseed fields, all the way to a ch�teau rising up white in a jewel green lawn. An automobile brought us down a slash of a burnt sienna drive, past golden-blossomed lindens and sprinkles of violets. Madame Cr�pet leaned over to me and said, &#x201c;Welcome to Mille Mots, Clare.&#x201d;<br><br>The people waiting in front were no different. Two young girls were introduced as maids, though they wore green flowered dresses instead of dark broadcloth. The butler had a great drooping orange mustache. The cook had her hair tied up in a paisley scarf. I heard the whispered buzz of French and was suddenly afraid to step from the car.<br><br>But then Madame Cr�pet took my hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your home for as long as you need, ma ch�re.&#x201d; Her words brought a lump to my throat and I swallowed it down. She slid off the lap shawl. &#x201c;Are you ready?&#x201d;<br><br>Was I? I didn&#x2019;t know. A week ago I&#x2019;d been back at Fairbridge, in the same square parcel of Scotland I&#x2019;d spent the past fifteen years. I left with Madame Cr�pet, thinking I was setting off on an adventure. I forgot that polite, well-bred girls weren&#x2019;t supposed to have adventures.<br><br>My head ached with the color and the light and the unfamiliar words my ears strained to catch. The air smelt like roses&#x2014;heady, drowsy roses. Wasn&#x2019;t it too early for them to be in bloom? A man approached the car, in a waistcoat speckled blue like a raven&#x2019;s egg. He smiled widely and held out both hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Can it be the petite princesse? I remember you, only as high as my knee and charming us all with your smile.&#x201d; He spoke English casually, Glaswegian vowels slipping in and out of his French accent. &#x201c;Do you not remember me?&#x201d;<br><br>It was an unfair question. Knee-high, I hadn&#x2019;t noticed much beyond the nursery. I stepped down from the automobile and regarded the man beneath the brim of my boater. He had a soft brown beard curling over his cravat and eyes dark as currants. Maybe I did remember him.<br><br>&#x201c;Monsieur Cr�pet, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>His grin broadened. &#x201c;Oui!&#x201d; He took both of my hands in his. &#x201c;Mademoiselle, welcome to my Picardy.&#x201d; He leaned forward and deposited a tickly kiss on each of my cheeks. Father always smelt of Rowland&#x2019;s Macassar Oil and the faint wood of pencil shavings, but as Monsieur Cr�pet leaned close, I smelt coffee and garlic, turpentine and tobacco. His cravat was spattered with green and yellow paint.<br><br>&#x201c;Your Picardy?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>Madame Cr�pet linked her arm through her husband&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Cher Claude, he&#x2019;d lay claim to all the most beautiful parts of France if he could.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only long enough to paint them,&#x201d; he said with a kiss to the back of her hand, one that sent her blushing like a schoolgirl.<br><br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;ll meet the last of our family tomorrow,&#x201d; Madame said. &#x201c;Our petit Luc, he&#x2019;ll be home from school. You probably don&#x2019;t remember him either.&#x201d;<br><br>Madame came to visit us in Perthshire each spring, staying for two weeks at Fairbridge, in the rose moir� guest suite. Only once do I remember her bringing her family along. I&#x2019;d forgotten that she had a son.<br><br>A mottled cat streaked out from the open front door, followed closely by a dog. The pair darted between legs before tearing off across the lawn. A maid yelped and jumped aside, Madame laughed, and the butler dropped his spectacles with what I was sure was a French curse.<br><br>Suddenly I was exhausted. Everything here was too bright, too loud, too different. I pressed my hands against the scratchy crepe of my skirt. In front of this aching white ch�teau, I was the only spot of black.<br><br>The bedroom was a quiet, faded blue.<br><br>The room was perched up at the top of a tower. Round stone walls were hung over with drooping tapestries that looked as though they&#x2019;d been there since Louis XVI; dusty, pastoral scenes of sheep and boys and overdressed shepherdesses. In the center of the room was an ancient bed, a heavy four-posted affair draped all around with curtains. It sagged in the middle and was piled with azure and lace and far too many pillows, but it was clean. I dropped my valise onto the bed and wished I was alone.<br><br>But the Cr�pets lingered, Madame fussing with the towel on the mismatched washstand and Monsieur adjusting the most crooked of the tapestries.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send Yvette up to unpack your trunk,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Monsieur Cr�pet let go of the tapestry. &#x201c;Rowena, I&#x2019;m sure the child wishes to rest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, of course.&#x201d; She rubbed her hands together. &#x201c;And supper . . . should I send up a tray?&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>As they left the room, Madame paused in the doorway. &#x201c;I hope you will regard Mille Mots as your home as long as you need to, my child. Your parents were dear friends and we mourn with you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, but I&#x2019;ll only be staying until you can find my mother.&#x201d;<br><br>Madame and Monsieur exchanged glances, the same kind that grown-ups had been exchanging over my head for the past six weeks.<br><br>&#x201c;Father always said she&#x2019;d return for me.&#x201d; There was that lump again in my throat, one I&#x2019;d been carrying around since the night he died.<br><br>Madame hesitated, so it was Monsieur who finally said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure she will.&#x201d;<br><br>When the door closed behind them, I fell onto the bed and wept.<br><br>Later that night, I woke grainy-eyed. A candle burnt low on the dressing table, next to a supper tray. I rubbed at my eyes with a wrinkled sleeve and pulled myself up from the bed. The tray held some slices of cold roasted duck, flecked with herbs and black pepper, a crusty chunk of bread, and some kind of soft, pungent cheese. Miss May, my governess, always said that pepper excessively aroused the constitution. I ate the bread in small torn bites and left the rest.<br><br>As I chewed, I went to the window and pushed it open. I wondered how late it was. Stars sprinkled across a sky as black as the one I&#x2019;d known in Scotland. Maybe France wasn&#x2019;t so different after all. In the dark, it didn&#x2019;t look as intimidating.<br><br>After Mother left, I used to slip from my bedroom onto the roof of Fairbridge, to look off across the night sky and wonder where she was. One night, I found my father while I was out on the roof.<br><br>He was in a rumpled cardigan and slippers, his hair uncombed. He leaned out of his own window, eyes fixed on the dark sky, the way mine were every night. I thought to creep back into my room, but without turning his head, he said, &#x201c;Do you know the constellations?&#x201d;<br><br>I stayed where I was, knees drawn up under my nightgown. &#x201c;No, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>He drew in a breath. &#x201c;That there, that&#x2019;s Pegasus.&#x201d; He pointed up at a faint collection of stars. &#x201c;Do you see? Look, there are his forelegs. That rectangle is his body. And straight on that way is his neck and head.&#x201d; He traced shapes with his finger, shapes that I couldn&#x2019;t see but trusted were there.<br><br>I scooted closer. &#x201c;And what else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There, next to Pegasus is Perseus, with his sword. There, and there.&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t want him to go inside and end this quiet conversation, the most I&#x2019;d had with him in a long while. &#x201c;I like the constellations.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do too.&#x201d; He sighed, a puff of frost in the dark night. &#x201c;The world may come and go, but the stars always stay the same.&#x201d;<br><br>I thought of that now, leaning out of the tower window of Mille Mots. Much of my little world had changed. I&#x2019;d lost the only person I had left. I&#x2019;d left Scotland. And yet, here in this strange ch�teau in this strange country, the constellations were still spread about above, keeping their stories for always.<br><br>Somewhere below my window, someone turned on a gramophone. I didn&#x2019;t recognize the music&#x2014;something lively and quick on a piano&#x2014;but a weight lifted in my heart.<br><br>&#x201c;Good night, Father,&#x201d; I whispered up to the stars, and crawled into bed with the gramophone music at the edge of my sleep.<br><br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>Clare<br><br>1911<br><br>The next morning, my growling stomach woke me up. Sunlight pushed against the corners of the bed curtains. France was still as bright as yesterday. I sat up. My dress was wrinkled and spotted with crumbs from last night&#x2019;s almost-meal. My impolite stomach informed me that it hadn&#x2019;t been enough.<br><br>I washed up and waited, but no one came to dress me or do my hair. No one brought a fresh tray. Maybe I was meant to dress myself and go down to the dining room. Did the French eat porridge for breakfast? I didn&#x2019;t know. They probably ate strange things like I&#x2019;d been given last night. My stomach growled again.<br><br>Somewhere outside my window there was a rhythmic thumping. I pictured woodsmen with axes, like in fairy tales, I pictured giants with butter churns, I pictured marching soldiers. I leaned out over the windowsill and looked for the sound, but all I could see was green lawn, tangled roses, and the mossy slate of the ch�teau&#x2019;s roof.<br><br>I took off my crumpled dress and all of my underthings. My trunk had been halfway unpacked at some point while I napped yesterday, maybe by whoever had brought my supper tray. I had to search through the trunk for fresh combinations and petticoats, for new stockings and garters, but those hateful black dresses of mine hung in a row in the crooked wardrobe.<br><br>I&#x2019;d had six weeks of black. I&#x2019;d had a lifetime of gray. In France, the palette was much bigger than that. The colors I&#x2019;d seen since arriving, they were ones I&#x2019;d only ever read on the unused tubes in Mother&#x2019;s paint box. Maybe that&#x2019;s why they overwhelmed me. I&#x2019;d never even seen them splashed across a canvas. But to see the ultramarines and viridians and carmines painted across a country, across a house, across people, I wondered. Did people feel the same when their lives were as bright as a painting? Could they mourn and wish and hate and dream when their days glowed with color? I thought again of the gramophone music drifting up through my window last night, those exuberant trips and trills of the piano. Here, so far from Scotland, so far from the life I&#x2019;d always had, could I be different, too? I shut the wardrobe and opened my valise.<br><br>The dress in there wasn&#x2019;t black and it wasn&#x2019;t new. It was an old dress of Mother&#x2019;s, a tea dress already five years out of fashion when she left it behind at Fairbridge. It had a pouty bodice, a froth of a skirt, and sleeves ending at my elbows in tiny pearl buttons. It was utterly romantic and as green as the Scottish hills in springtime. I&#x2019;d cut it down and basted it with my embroidery needles when Miss May wasn&#x2019;t looking. It wasn&#x2019;t stiff crepe, it wasn&#x2019;t mourning black, it wasn&#x2019;t sedate as schoolrooms. It was just the different I needed.<br><br>I slipped into the green dress. It felt faintly rebellious, to be putting on a color only six weeks into mourning. Miss May, that old Victorian relic, would faint at the thought. But she wasn&#x2019;t here. Madame Cr�pet, with her honeycomb yellow dress, Monsieur with his paint-spattered coat, and Mille Mots, so white and green and twined with flowers, they were here, and I meant to be part of them. I sent a quick, guilty prayer up to Father, hoping he&#x2019;d forgive me.<br><br>I finger-combed my hair back and regarded myself in the mirror. I wondered if I looked older. I wondered if I looked like a little girl playing dress-up. I supposed there was only one way to find out.<br><br>The rest of Mille Mots was as shabby as my bedroom. The hallways were lined with peeling wallpaper and mismatched furniture. Here and there, on scuffed tables, perched sculptures, some grotesque in their subjects, some heartrendingly beautiful. I found a staircase carpeted in a faded green runner that led down to the front hall I remembered from yesterday, all pale stone and dark wood and a cacophony of paintings. I hadn&#x2019;t been given a proper tour. I wasn&#x2019;t sure which way to the breakfast room.<br><br>As I was standing in the hall, contemplating four equally quiet doorways leading to places unknown, the front opened with a bang. A boy entered, whistling and swinging a tennis racket. It barely missed me.<br><br>I ducked. &#x201c;Blast, but France is a dangerous place!&#x201d;<br><br>The boy broke off with his whistling and stared.<br><br>He wasn&#x2019;t exactly a boy, I realized upon second glance. He was fully a head taller than me. Fresh from his exercise&#x2014;his dark hair damp and curling, his shirt spotted with sweat, his face pink from exertion&#x2014;he looked a man.<br><br>&#x201c;Pardon,&#x201d; I said, and stepped back against the wall.<br><br>He tilted his head. I didn&#x2019;t know who he was to stare. He wasn&#x2019;t dressed like a gentleman at sport. Father always wore a jacket, even when playing croquet. I felt a pang thinking of Father, always respectable. But this man wore neither jacket nor vest. Just a white shirt, open at the neck, tucked into loose trousers. Like a pirate, he&#x2019;d tied a crimson scarf around his waist.<br><br>My face burned under his scrutiny and I looked down at the toes of my boots.<br><br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re right, of course. France is a dangerous place.&#x201d; I looked up to see his eyes twinkling. He brandished his racket like a fencing sword. &#x201c;It is a country of the three musketeers, of the guillotine, of opera ghosts. But it&#x2019;s also a place of art and of love.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have art in Scotland,&#x201d; I said, a trifle defensively.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, are you an artist, mademoiselle?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m only fifteen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m nineteen, but what does that matter?&#x201d;<br><br>Maybe he&#x2019;d understand about the scores of sketchbooks in my valise. &#x201c;Are you then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I sketch Paris for tourists. Amongst other things.&#x201d;</p><h2>Queen of Peace Visits Medugorje</h2><p>Since June 1981, when six children claimed to receive daily visits by the Virgin Mary, people have poured into Medugorje hoping to share in the remarkable events and special messages. This book has been described as the best basic account of the Medugorje phenomenon.</p><p>Father Pelletier, Augustinian of the Assumption, educator and college administrator, has written seven books since 1952 about Marian apparitions. In this one he writes about visionaries he was privileged to see communicating with their heavenly visitor. The Queen of Peace, began appearing in June 1981 to four girls and two boys, from ten to sixteen years old, on a daily and even more frequent basis, and has continued almost without interruption. Then in December 1982 she began to speak to two ten year-old girls in completely separate manifestations. Six years later Our Lady still comes to Medugorje bringing hope to all believes in a sin-filled world. Accomplished narrator, fervent supporter of devotion to Mary, astute interpreter of heavenly behavior, Father Pelletier writes with simplicity and touching appeal. All updating since his death has sought to preserve and enhance his presentation of Our Lady&#39;s impact on the lives of people of faith, whether lay person, priest, or religious. - Alexis Babineau, A.A., editor</p><h2>On the Incarnation</h2><p>Two names stand above all others in the history of the early Christian church: Augustine and Athanasius. The former was from the West and contended for the doctrine of grace against Roman moralism, while the latter came from the East and became a champion of orthodoxy against Arian attacks on the doctrine of the Trinity. <i>On the Incarnation</i> was Athanasius&#x2019; second apologetic work, and in it he defends the Christian faith and tries to convince Jews and Greeks that Jesus was not a prophet or teacher but the Christ, the divine incarnation of God&#x2019;s Word.<br> You may find yourself reading Athanasius and thinking that the divine incarnation of Jesus is an obvious point, only to realize that, at some point, it wasn&#x2019;t so obvious. Three hundred years after Jesus ascended to heaven, the Council of Nicaea was still trying to figure out exactly who Jesus was. Through his presence at the Council of Nicaea as an assistant to Alexander and his work in this writing, Athanasius helped early Christianity&#x2014;indeed all Christianity&#x2014;to understand something more of the mystery of our faith: God was manifested in the flesh. All Christians, directly or indirectly, have been influenced by Athanasius because of his foundational insistence of who Jesus is.<br> There is perhaps no other Christian writing in which the coming of our Savior is proclaimed so clearly as the way of victory over death. Thanks to Athanasius, and so many other early Christian thinkers, we have a firmer footing in our own exploration and understanding of who God is and how He works.</p><p>Athanasius (c. 297&#x2013;373), Bishop of Alexandria and one of the most illustrious defenders of the Christian faith, was born at Alexandria around 297 AD. He is known as a church father, a noted Egyptian leader, a master theologian, and a staunch defender of Trinitarianism against the arguments of Arianism, which he began as a bishop&#x2019;s assistant at the First Council of Nicaea. He also struggled against several Roman emperors, which caused seventeen of his forty-five years as bishop to be spent in exile. His writings were cherished by church fathers, both in the West and the East. He is known for his devotion to the Word-become-man, his great pastoral concern, and a profound interest in monasticism. He is venerated by the Roman Catholic Church, Oriental and Eastern Orthodox churches, the Lutheran Church, and the Anglican Communion.</p><h2>The Movie Theater Mystery #7 (The Whodunit Detective Agency)</h2><p><b>Jerry and Maya are on the case again!</b><br><br>Doodle Bug is the third dog that has mysteriously disappeared in Pleasant Valley. But the police chief has no idea who the dog-napper might be. When Jerry and Maya hear strange sounds coming from the basement of the Rio Cinema, they quickly realize it just might be a clue. Can Pleasant Valley's doggy detectives get to the bottom of this canine caper?</p><p>Martin Widmark was born in 1961 in Sweden and today lives in Stockholm with his family. He has worked as a middle-school instructor and a Swedish-language teacher for immigrants, but he is now a full-time children&#39;s book author. Over his career, he has also written several textbooks. He is fascinated by life&#39;s little oddities and anything unique, from food and music to languages and people.<p><b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;A Singing Dog</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;</b>Look!&#x201d; said Maya. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s happened again!&#x201d; She passed Jerry the newspaper and jabbed at an article. The two friends were relaxing in their favorite comfy armchairs in Maya&#x2019;s basement. Maya&#x2019;s basement: otherwise known as the Whodunit Detective Agency Headquarters. They kept everything they needed to run their agency there.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jerry read the newspaper while Maya grabbed their scrapbook and a pair of scissors.<br> &nbsp;<br> The scrapbook was full of articles they had found about all sorts of crimes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Another dog stolen.&#x201d; Jerry sighed when he finished the article.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That makes the third one this week. Look at this,&#x201d; said Maya, opening the scrapbook in front of Jerry.<br> &nbsp;<br> She pointed to two other articles that she had pasted under her own headline: &#x201c;Disappearing Dogs.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s <i>got </i>to be a connection between all these thefts,&#x201d; said Jerry.<br> &nbsp;<br> Maya picked up the scrapbook and nodded. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s read the article again and see if there are any similarities between the cases.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They each took out their notebooks. As they read, Jerry and Maya wrote down the main points in each article. Then they compared what they had written.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only small dogs have disappeared,&#x201d; noted Jerry. &#x201c;No big dogs. I wonder why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s easier to run off with a small dog,&#x201d; said Maya. &#x201c;And a small dog probably isn&#x2019;t as dangerous as a big dog.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The dogs have been stolen all over town,&#x201d; said Jerry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right: outside the library, by the church, and in front of the hotel,&#x201d; continued Maya, as she checked over her notes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The dogs were all stolen at around the same time, between seven and seven thirty at night,&#x201d; said Jerry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The owners had left the dogs unattended for only a few minutes,&#x201d; Maya said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But still long enough for the dog thief to strike,&#x201d; said Jerry, scratching his nose thoughtfully with his pen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Maya snipped out the most recent article from the paper and pasted it into the scrapbook.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What else do we know?&#x201d; asked Jerry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;According to the paper, each dog owner received a mysterious phone call shortly after the disappearance,&#x201d; said Maya. &#x201c;None of them recognized the voice on the other end of the line. The caller demanded that each owner pay one thousand dollars&#x2014;or they will never see their pets again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The owners must be frantic!&#x201d; said Jerry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And the dogs, too.&#x201d; Maya sighed. &#x201c;Someone rotten&nbsp; enough to steal a dog is probably rotten enough to treat them poorly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Read it again, Maya, and let&#x2019;s see if we missed anything,&#x201d; said Jerry. He closed his eyes to concentrate. Maya straightened up, cleared her throat, and began to read.<br> &nbsp;<br> Maya shut the book with a snap. Jerry jumped. One look at her face and he could tell that she was angry. Very angry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to do something,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to stand up for those innocent dogs!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The two detectives slouched in their armchairs and thought about what they <i>could</i> do. But they didn&#x2019;t come up with any good ideas. Finally, Jerry said, &#x201c;The dogs won&#x2019;t come back just because we&#x2019;re sitting here worrying. Let&#x2019;s take a break and clear our heads. That new cowboy movie opened at the Rio Cinema today. Maybe it will give us some ideas. Come on, Maya! Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Maya sighed and got up from her armchair. She put the scrapbook down on the desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A change of scenery will do me good. I&#x2019;m too angry to think straight now! What kind of person would be cruel enough to steal someone&#x2019;s pet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The newspaper articles made it clear: Pleasant Valley had a criminal on the loose. Maya had a feeling their detective agency would soon have a new case to solve!<br><br></p></p><h2>Fodor's The Best of Italy: Rome, Florence, Venice &amp; the Top Spots in Between (Full-color Travel Guide, 1)</h2><p><p>Written by locals, Fodor's travel guides have been offering expert advice for all tastes and budgets for over 80 years.</p><p>Unforgettable art, heavenly villages, dream cities--there are so many reasons to visit Italy that deciding where to go and what to do can be overwhelming.

Raised in the Virgin Islands, he lives in New York City, where he worked for many years at Murder Ink�, the world's first mystery bookstore.&nbsp;tomsavagebooks.comA cool, smart, and stylish first thriller--St. Thomas-set--of murder plot and counterplot that features a major twist in nearly every one of its 18 tightly woven chapters. After a preface set 20 years back, detailing the discovery by a Long Island postman of a dead woman and, clutching a knife and saying, ``I killed her,'' her bloodstained little girl, Savage moves to today's Caribbean. Right away, we read that ``The idea of murder, once formed in her mind, simply would not go away.'' In whose mind? Well, many readers will ignore the ellipses at the end of the first paragraph and, going on to read that ``Kay watched the girl from her chaise lounge...,'' will assume that the potential murderess is Kay--though it's soon revealed that Kay is the intended victim, and ``the girl'' the killer--just one tiny way in which Savage plays with prose-and-plot conventions to spin expectations around. The girl, a young beauty calling herself Diana Meissen (like most everyone here, she's not who she claims), gets herself hired as governess to Kay's daughter--and that night is kissing Kay's handsome, middle-aged husband, Adam: ``I wanted so much to call you....'' Are Diana and Adam planning to kill Kay? So it seems--especially when Adam commits a series of robbery-slayings in order to blame Kay's death on a homicidal thief. But how do these killings relate to identical ones ten and twenty years before? How do they tie in with the young man, allegedly a real- estate developer, who's spying on Diana? Or with the girl who held the knife years ago? Surprise piles upon surprise, logically, convincingly, until all secrets--revolving around an old family horror--are resolved in a climax that owes a debt to Greek tragedy. Not so much suspenseful as intellectually satisfying: a finely wrought, unusually clever literary debut--and a natural for the movies. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This is perhaps nowhere more evident than in how the nation&#x2019;s chief executive has tackled myriad issues upon entering the White House. The ways that U.S. presidents handle the vast responsibilities of the Oval Office determine the fate of the nation---and, in many cases, the fate of the world.</p><p>In this fascinating narrative, presidential historian Mark Updegrove looks at eight U.S. presidents who inherited unprecedented crises immediately upon assuming the reigns of power. George Washington led a fragile and fledgling nation while defining the very role of the presidency. When Thomas Jefferson entered the White House, he faced a nation bitterly divided by a two-party schism far more severe than anything encountered today. John Tyler stepped into the office of the presidency during the constitutional crisis left by the first death of a sitting president. Abraham Lincoln inherited a divided nation on the brink of war. Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to quell America&#x2019;s fears during the depths of the Great Depression. His successor, Harry S. Truman, was sworn in as commander in chief at the close of World War II, and John F. Kennedy stepped into the increasingly heated atmosphere of the cold war. In the wake of Watergate, the first unelected president, Gerald R. Ford, aimed to end America&#x2019;s &#x201c;long national nightmare.&#x201d;</p><p>As the forty-fourth president takes office, Updegrove presents a timely look at these chief executives and the challenges they faced. In examining the ways in which presidents have addressed crises, <i>Baptism by Fire</i> illustrates the importance of character in leadership&#x2014;and in the resilience of America itself.&nbsp; </p></p><p><p>Mark K. Updegrove is the author of <i>Second Acts: Presidential Lives and Legacies After the White House,</i> which won <i>ForeWord Magazine</i>&#x2019;s&nbsp;Silver&nbsp;&#x201c;Book of the Year&#x201d; Award&nbsp;for Political&nbsp;Science.

Currently, he is an advertising executive and lives outside Charleston, South Carolina.</p>The newest presidential history from former Newsweek editor Updegrove (Second Acts: Presidential Lives and Legacies After the White House) looks at eight presidents who took office at critical moments in U.S. history and shaped American notions of presidential authority and purview: Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, Tyler, Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy and Ford. Updegrove drafts short accounts of each administration, succinctly examining how each helped define and refine the office. By calling upon little known trivia and providing useful context, he weaves an engaging narrative; however, it isn't without its flaws. Updegrove can't seem to resist contrasting the decisions of these time-honored presidents with current President George W. Bush, and his liberal eye glosses over some of the uglier aspects of these Commanders-in-Chiefs-ironically deifying men who, by Updegrove's own account, wanted desperately to be viewed as men, not legends. Ultimately, this is a satisfying read for armchair historians with sympathetic politics, particularly in the attention it calls to aspects of the office (the assumption of power by the vice-president, term limits, etc.) now largely taken for granted. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Troiani is at his best in the battle paintings--his attention to detail and insistence on historical accuracy help him capture the valor and confusion of combat--but the book includes more bucolic depictions of camp life, as well. Brian Pohanka's accompanying text illuminates the stories behind the paintings. For example, he describes a famous episode from Second Manassas where Confederate soldiers ran out of bullets during a Union assault; the beleaguered Rebels resorted to throwing rocks at the Union lines. Troiani captures this desperate action magnificently. Because the narrative focuses on these small stories, it sometimes misses the big picture; so while the text and paintings are presented in chronological order from 1861 to 1865, it makes for only a so-so recounting of the war overall. But this is not a book you read so much as experience. <i>--Thomas Prowell</i>Don Troiani attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and New York City&#39;s Art Students League. His artwork is in numerous major collections, including American Heritage magazine, the National Park Service, the U. S.

The prime example is man-about-town Bertie Wooster, doing a good turn to Gussie Fink-Nottle by impersonating him while he enjoys fourteen days away from society after being caught taking an unscheduled dip in the fountains of Trafalgar Square. Bertie is of course one of nature&#39;s gentlemen, but the stakes are high: if all is revealed, there&#39;s a danger that Gussie&#39;s simpering fiance Madeline may turn her wide eyes on Bertie instead. It&#39;s a brilliant plan - until Gussie himself turns up, imitating Bertram Wooster. After that, only the massive brain of Jeeves (himself in disguise) can set things right.</p><p>Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (always known as `Plum&#39;) wrote more than ninety novels and some three hundred short stories over 73 years. He is widely recognised as the greatest 20th-century writer of humour in the English language.

His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club.

It is Mothering Sunday. How will Jane Fairchild, orphan and housemaid, occupy her time when she has no mother to visit? How, shaped by the events of this never to be forgotten day, will her future unfold? Beginning with an intimate assignation and opening to embrace decades, Mothering Sunday has at its heart both the story of a life and the life that stories can magically contain. Constantly surprising, joyously sensual and deeply moving, it is Graham Swift at his thrilling best.</p><p>Graham Swift was born in 1949 and is the author of nine novels, a collection of short stories and Making an Elephant, a book of essays, portraits, poetry and reflections on his life in writing. With Waterland he won the Guardian Fiction Prize, and with Last Orders the Booker Prize. Both novels have since been made into films. Graham Swift&#39;s work has appeared in over thirty languages.ONCE UPON A TIME,&nbsp;before the boys were killed and when there were more horses than cars, before the male servants disappeared and they made do, at Upleigh and at Beechwood, with just a cook and a maid, the Sheringhams had owned not just four horses in their own stable, but what might be called a &#x201c;real horse,&#x201d; a racehorse, a thoroughbred. Its name was Fandango. It was stabled near Newbury. It had never won a damn thing. But it was the family&#x2019;s indulgence, their hope for fame and glory on the racecourses of southern England. The deal was that Ma and Pa&#x2014;otherwise known in his strange language as &#x201c;the shower&#x201d;&#x2014;owned the head and body and he and Dick and Freddy had a leg each.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about the fourth leg?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh the fourth leg. That was always the question.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> For most of the time it was just a name, never seen, though an expensively quartered and trained name. It had been sold in 1915&#x2014;when he&#x2019;d been fifteen too. &#x201c;Before you showed up, Jay.&#x201d; But once, long ago, early one June morning, they&#x2019;d all gone, for the strange, mad expedition of it, just to watch it, just to watch Fandango, their horse, being galloped over the downs. Just to stand at the rail and watch it, with other horses, thundering towards them, then flashing past. He and Ma and Pa and Dick and Freddy. And&#x2014;who knows?&#x2014;some other ghostly interested party who really owned the fourth leg.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had a hand on her leg.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the only time she&#x2019;d known his eyes go anything close to misty. And she&#x2019;d had the clear sharp vision (she would have it still when she was ninety) that she might have gone with him&#x2014;might still somehow miraculously go with him, just him&#x2014;to stand at the rail and watch Fandango hurtle past, kicking up the mud and dew. She had never seen such a thing but she could imagine it, imagine it clearly. The sun still coming up, a red disc, over the grey downs, the air still&nbsp;crisp and cold, while he shared with her, perhaps, a silver-capped hip flask and, not especially stealthily, clawed her arse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> BUT SHE WATCHED&nbsp;him now move, naked but for a silver signet ring, across the sunlit room. She would not later in life use with any readiness, if at all, the word &#x201c;stallion&#x201d; for a man. But such he was. He was twenty-three and she was twenty-two. And he was even what you might call a thoroughbred, though she did not have that word then, any more than she had the word &#x201c;stallion.&#x201d; She did not yet have a million words. Thoroughbred: since it was &#x201c;breeding&#x201d; and &#x201c;birth&#x201d; that counted with his kind. Never mind to what actual purpose.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was March 1924. It wasn&#x2019;t June, but it was a day like June. And it must have been a little after noon. A window was flung open, and he walked, unclad, across the sun-filled room as carelessly as any unclad animal. It was his room, wasn&#x2019;t it? He could do what he liked in it. He clearly could. And she had never been in it before, and never would be again.<br> &nbsp;<br> And she was naked too.<br> &nbsp;<br> March 30th 1924. Once upon a time. The shadows from the latticework in the window slipped over him like foliage. Having gathered up the cigarette case and lighter and a little silver ashtray from the dressing table, he turned, and there, beneath a nest of dark hair and fully bathed by sunshine, were his cock and balls, mere floppy and still sticky appendages. She could look at them if she liked, he didn&#x2019;t mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then he could look at her. She was stretched out naked, except for a pair&#x2014;her only pair&#x2014;of very cheap earrings. She hadn&#x2019;t pulled up the sheet. She had even clasped her hands behind her head the better to look at him. But he could look at her. Feast your eyes. It was an expression that came to her. Expressions had started to come to her. Feast your eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Outside, all Berkshire stretched out too, girded with bright greenery, loud with birdsong, blessed in March with a day in June.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was still a follower of horses. That is, he still threw money away on them. It was his version of economising, to throw money away. For nearly eight years he&#x2019;d had money for three, in theory. He called it &#x201c;loot.&#x201d; But he would show he could do without it. And what the two of them had been doing for almost seven years cost, as he would sometimes remind her, absolutely nothing. Except secrecy and risk and cunning and a mutual aptitude for being good at it.<br> &nbsp;<br> But they had never done anything like this. She had never been in this bed before&#x2014;it was a single bed, but roomy. Or in this room, or in this house. If it cost nothing, then this was the greatest of gifts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though if it cost nothing, she might always remind him, then what about the times when he&#x2019;d given her sixpences? Or was it even threepences? When it was only just beginning, before it got&#x2014;was it the right word?&#x2014;serious. But she would never dare remind him. And not now anyway. Or dare throw at him the word &#x201c;serious.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He sat on the bed beside her. He ran a hand across her belly as if brushing away invisible dust. Then he arranged on it the lighter and ashtray, retaining the cigarette case. He took two cigarettes from the case, putting one in her own proffered, pouting lips. She had not taken her hands from the back of her head. He lit hers, then his. Then, gathering up the case and lighter to put on the bedside table, he stretched out beside her, the ashtray still positioned halfway between her navel and what these days he would happily, making no bones about it, call her &#x201c;cunt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cock, balls, cunt. There were some simple, basic expressions.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was March 30th. It was a Sunday. It was what used to be known as Mothering Sunday.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;WELL,&nbsp;you have a gorgeous day for it, Jane,&#x201d; Mr. Niven had said as she brought in fresh coffee and toast.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said and she&#x2019;d wondered quite what he meant by &#x201c;it&#x201d; in her case.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A truly gorgeous day.&#x201d; As if it were something he had generously provided. And then to Mrs. Niven, &#x201c;You know, if someone had told us it was going to be like this, we might as well have all packed hampers. A picnic&#x2014;by the river.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He said it wistfully, yet eagerly, so that, putting down the toast rack, she&#x2019;d thought for an instant there might actually be a change of plan and she and Milly would be required to pack a hamper. Wherever the hamper&nbsp;<i>was</i>, and whatever they were supposed to put in it at such inconsiderate notice. This being&nbsp;<i>their</i>&nbsp;day.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then Mrs. Niven had said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s March, Godfrey,&#x201d; with a distrusting glance towards the window.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, she&#x2019;d been wrong. The day had only got better.<br> &nbsp;<br> And anyway the Nivens had their plan, on which the weather could only smile. They were to drive to Henley to meet the Hobdays and the Sheringhams. Given their common predicament&#x2014;which only occurred once a year and only for a portion of one day&#x2014;they were all to meet for lunch at Henley and so deal with the temporary bother of having no servants.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the Hobdays&#x2019; idea&#x2014;or invitation. Paul Sheringham was to marry Emma Hobday in just two weeks&#x2019; time. So the Hobdays had suggested to the Sheringhams an outing for lunch: an opportunity to toast and talk over the forthcoming event, as well as a solution to Sunday&#x2019;s practical difficulty. And then because the Nivens were close friends and neighbours of the Sheringhams and would be honoured guests at the wedding (and would have the same difficulty), the Nivens&#x2014;as Mr. Niven had put it to her when first notifying her of these arrangements&#x2014;had been &#x201c;roped in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This had all made clear one thing she knew already. Whatever else Paul Sheringham was marrying, he was marrying money. Perhaps he had to, the way he got through his own. The Hobdays would be paying in two weeks&#x2019; time for a grand wedding, and did you really need to celebrate a forthcoming celebration? Not unless you had plenty to spare. It might demand nothing less than champagne. When Mr. Niven had mentioned the hamper he had perhaps been wondering how much the Hobdays&#x2019; liberality could be relied on or how much the day might involve his own pocket.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that the Hobdays had plenty to spare pleased her. It had nothing to do with her, but it pleased her. That Emma Hobday might be made of five-pound notes, that the marriage might be an elaborate way of obtaining &#x201c;loot,&#x201d; pleased or, rather, consoled her. It was all the other things it might entail that&#x2014;even as Mr. Niven explained about the &#x201c;roping in&#x201d;&#x2014;gnawed at her.<br> &nbsp;<br> And would Mister Paul and Miss Hobday be joining the party themselves? She couldn&#x2019;t really ask it directly, vital as it was to her to know. And Mr. Niven didn&#x2019;t volunteer the information.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Would you mention these arrangements to Milly? None of it of course need affect&#x2014;your own arrangements.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was not often that he had the occasion to say such a thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A jamboree in Henley, Jane. A meeting of the tribes. Let&#x2019;s hope we have the weather for it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She wasn&#x2019;t quite sure what &#x201c;jamboree&#x201d; meant, though she felt she had read the word somewhere. But &#x201c;jam&#x201d; suggested something jolly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hope so too, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> AND NOW&nbsp;they clearly had the weather for it, and Mr. Niven, whatever his earlier misgivings, was indeed getting rather jolly. He was going&nbsp;to be driving himself. He had already announced that they might as well set off soon, so they could &#x201c;pootle around&#x201d; and take advantage of such a lovely morning. He wouldn&#x2019;t, apparently, be calling on Alf at the garage, who&#x2014;for the right sum&#x2014;could become a convincing chauffeur. In any case, as she&#x2019;d observed over recent years, Mr. Niven liked driving. He even preferred the pleasure of driving to the dignity of being driven. It gave him a boyish zest. And as he was always saying, with a whole variety of intonations, ranging from bluster to lament, times were changing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once upon a time, after all, the Nivens would have met the Sheringhams at Sunday service.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tribes&#x201d; had suggested something hot and outdoors. She knew it was to be the George Hotel in Henley. It was not to be a picnic. And it might well have been a day, since it was still March, of evil gales, even snow. But it was a morning like a morning in summer. And Mrs. Niven left the table to go up to get herself ready.<br> &nbsp;<br> She couldn&#x2019;t ask, even now with Mr. Niven conveniently alone, &#x201c;Would Miss Hobday and...?&#x201d; Even if it sounded like just a maid&#x2019;s idle curiosity. Wasn&#x2019;t the coming wedding the only current talking-point? And she certainly couldn&#x2019;t ask, &#x201c;If not, then what other separate arrangements might the two of them have in mind?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t think that if she were one half of a betrothed couple&#x2014;or at least Paul Sheringham&#x2019;s half&#x2014;she would want, two weeks before their wedding, to attend a jamboree in Henley to be fussed over by the older generation (by what he might have called&#x2014;she could see him speaking with a cigarette in his mouth and wincingly screwing up his eyes&#x2014;&#x201c;three bloody showers together&#x201d;).<br> &nbsp;<br> But in any case, if she got no further information, it still left the problem that was peculiarly hers on this day, as Mr. Niven knew, of what to do with it. Today it was painfully peculiar. The gorgeous weather didn&#x2019;t necessarily help at all. It only seemed&#x2014;with two weeks to go&#x2014;to deepen a shadow.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was going to say to Mr. Niven, when the moment came, that if he&#x2014;if he and Mrs. Niven&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t mind, she might not &#x201c;go&#x201d; anywhere. She might just stay here at Beechwood and read a book if that was all right&#x2014;&#x201c;her book&#x201d; as she might put it, though it belonged to Mr. Niven. She might just sit somewhere in the sunshine in the garden.<br> &nbsp;<br> She knew that Mr. Niven could only approve of such a harmless suggestion. He might even think it was a rather appealing image. And of course it would mean she&#x2019;d be ready to resume her duties at once, whenever they returned. She could find something to eat in the kitchen. Milly, before she left, might even make her a sandwich. She could have her own &#x201c;picnic.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And it might even have happened just like that. The bench in the nook by the sundial. Bumblebees tricked by the weather. The magnolia tree already loaded with blossom. Her book on her lap. She knew which book it would be.<br> &nbsp;<br> So&#x2014;she would put the idea to Mr. Niven.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then the telephone had rung and&#x2014;it being one of her numberless duties&#x2014;she&#x2019;d hastened to answer it. And her heart had soared. That was a phrase you read in books, but it was sometimes actually true of what happened to people. It was true then of herself. Her heart had soared, like some stranded heroine&#x2019;s in a story. Like the larks she would hear in a little while, trilling and soaring high in the blue sky, as she pedalled her way to Upleigh.<br> &nbsp;<br> But she&#x2019;d been careful to say, quite loudly, into the receiver and with her best answering-the-telephone voice that was both maid-like and somewhat queenly, &#x201c;Yes, madam.&#x201d;</p><h2>They Speak With Other Tongues</h2><p>John Sherrill was a skeptic as far as miracles were concerned. He lived in a suburb with his family, attended a mainstream church, and although he believed in the power of the Holy Spirit, he had never seen it manifested.

Resources in this area often prove overspecialized and arcane, and can require highly sophisticated skills in cultural anthropology or Semitic languages just to read the table of contents. <i>Social World of Ancient Israel, 1250-587 BCE</i> offers those interested in learning about the biblical world a more user-friendly framework for viewing the broader picture; at the same time it relies upon the latest methodologies of cultural anthropology and biblical analysis in its presentation. Painting a picture in broad but precise strokes, the authors portray the landscape of ancient Israel in new and exciting colors that expert and student alike will appreciate.<br><br><i>Social World of Ancient Israel </i>takes a unique look at the most prominent social institutions of the world of early Israel and the period of the monarchy, and then shows how properly understanding these social institutions is essential for sound biblical interpretation. Immersing the reader into five major areas of daily life in antiquity--politics, economics, diplomacy, law, and education--Matthews and Benjamin explore the ways in which knowing how "players" function in these institutions, such as "father/mother," "prophet/wise one," "host/stranger," can shape our understanding of earliest Israel. Perhaps most significantly, the book gently exposes the inefficiency of past anthropological models for interpreting the relationships, attitudes and social conventions of earliest Israel. Its corrective insights will enable scholar and student alike to plot new approaches for studying the Hebrew Bible and the ancient people of Israel.</p><p>Victor H.

For many schools, if it is colder than 20 below zero, they stay indoors; otherwise, it&#39;s outside for frosty fun! This is is a photo book with text written from a child&#39;s perspective on what kids to during recess at 20 below. We see kids getting ready for recess putting on layers of outdoor clothing, and then somebody has to go to the bathroom! Going sledding, swinging, running around outside with frosted-up eyelashes and face masks. Then the aftermath: static hair after a hat&#39;s been pulled off, red cheeks and noses, etc. Young readers will delight in images of peers frolicking in the cold and during their favorite time of the school day!</p><p><b>2006 CBC/Notable Social Studies Trade Books</b> <br> <b>Battle of the Books Selection</b> <br> <b>2006 IRA Children's Notable Books</b><p></p> <p><b>Cindy Lou Aillaud:</b> There is a certain magic that happens in winter when the temperatures drop to colder than 20 below.

Past-life regression? Reincarnation? Are these sorts of things <em>Jewish?</em> </b></p><p>With a blend of candor, personal questioning and sharp-eyed scholarship, Rabbi Elie Kaplan Spitz relates his own observations and the firsthand accounts shared with him by others, experiences that helped propel his journey from skeptic to believer that there is life after life.</p><p>From near-death experiences to reincarnation, past-life memory to the work of mediums, Rabbi Spitz explores what we are really able to know about the afterlife, and draws on Jewish texts to share that belief in these concepts&#x2015;so often approached with reluctance&#x2015;is in fact true to Jewish tradition.</p><blockquote><p>"The increasing interest and faith in survival of the soul may grow into a cultural wave that is as potentially transformative for society as the civil rights movement and feminism.

Spitz, who teaches the philosophy of law at the University of Judaism, carefully describes traditional Jewish views of the afterlife and fearlessly explores the many challenges to those views arising in parapsychology--including near-death experiences, reincarnation, and spirit mediums. In the end, Spitz makes a cogent argument that belief in the afterlife is not, as has often been argued, incompatible with Jewish tradition. Wisely, he grounds his concluding arguments in the present-oriented ethic that guides Jewish devotion: "Our challenge is to use the time we have now to live gratefully and responsibly, knowing that how we choose to live shapes our soul," he argues. "The ability to accept death as part of life provides comfort and the awareness that each day is precious. Our challenge is to make the best of every day in this life." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p><strong>Rabbi Elie Kaplan Spitz</strong> is the author of <em><em>Healing from Despair: </em>Choosing Wholeness in a Broken World</em> and<em> Does the Soul Survive?

Plenty of people are busy. I have a high-powered job, my career is important to me, and I enjoy it.<br><br> OK. So sometimes I do feel a bit tense. But I&#x2019;m a lawyer in the City, for God&#x2019;s sake. What do you expect?<br><br> My handwriting is pressing so hard into the page, I&#x2019;ve torn the paper. Dammit. Never mind.

Across the room, Maya looks up from where she&#x2019;s rearranging all her little pots of wax and nail varnish. Maya is my spa beauty therapist for the day and is in her forties, I&#x2019;d say. Her long dark hair is in a plait with one white streak woven through it, and she has a tiny silver stud in her nose.<br><br> &#x201c;Everything all right with the questionnaire?&#x201d; she murmurs.<br><br> &#x201c;I did mention that I&#x2019;m in a bit of a hurry,&#x201d; I say politely. &#x201c;Are all these questions absolutely necessary?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;At the Green Tree Center we like to have as much information as possible to assess your beauty and health needs,&#x201d; she replies in soothing yet implacable tones.<br><br> I glance at my watch.

But it&#x2019;s my birthday treat and I promised my best friend, Freya.<br><br> To be more accurate, it&#x2019;s last year&#x2019;s birthday treat. Freya gave me the gift voucher for an &#x201c;Ultimate De-stress Experience&#x201d; just over a year ago. She&#x2019;s my oldest school friend and is always on at me for working too hard. In the card that came with the voucher she wrote Make Some Time For Yourself, Samantha!!!<br><br> Which I did fully intend to do. But we had the Zincon Petrochemical Group restructuring and the Zeus Minerals merger . . . and somehow a year went by without my finding a spare moment. I&#x2019;m a lawyer with Carter Spink. I work in the corporate department on the finance side, and just at the moment, things are pretty hectic with some big deals on. It&#x2019;s a blip. It&#x2019;ll get better. I just have to get through the next couple of weeks.<br><br> Anyway, then Freya sent me this year&#x2019;s birthday card&#x2014;and I suddenly realized the voucher was about to expire. So here I am, on my twenty-ninth birthday. Sitting on a couch in a white toweling robe and surreal paper knickers. With a half-day window. Max.<br><br> Do you smoke?<br><br> No.<br><br> Do you drink alcohol?<br><br> Yes. The odd glass of wine.<br><br> Do you eat regular home-cooked meals?<br><br> What does that have to do with anything? What makes &#x201c;home-cooked&#x201d; meals superior?<br><br> I eat a nutritious, varied diet, I write at last.<br><br> Which is absolutely true.<br><br> Anyway, everyone knows the Chinese live longer than we do&#x2014;so what could be more healthy than to eat their food? And pizza is Mediterranean. It&#x2019;s probably more healthy than a home-cooked meal.<br><br> Do you feel your life is balanced?<br><br> Yes.<br><br> N<br><br> Yes.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done,&#x201d; I announce, and hand the pages back to Maya, who starts reading through my answers. Her finger is traveling down the paper at a snail&#x2019;s pace. Like we&#x2019;ve got all the time in the world.<br><br> Which she may well have. But I seriously have to be back in the office by one.<br><br> Maya looks up, a thoughtful expression on her face. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re obviously quite a stressed-out woman.&#x201d;<br><br> What? Where does she get that from? I specifically put on the form, I am not stressed-out.<br><br> &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d; I hope Maya&#x2019;s taking in my relaxed, see-how-unstressed-I-am smile. She looks unconvinced.<br><br> &#x201c;Your job is obviously very pressured.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I thrive under pressure,&#x201d; I explain. Which is true. I&#x2019;ve known that about myself ever since . . .<br><br> Well. Ever since my mother told me, when I was about eight. You thrive under pressure, Samantha. Our whole family thrives under pressure. It&#x2019;s like our family motto or something.<br><br> Apart from my brother Peter, of course. He had a nervous breakdown. But the rest of us.<br><br> I love my job. I love spotting the loophole in a contract. I love the thrill of negotiation, and arguing my case, and making the sharpest point in the room. I love the adrenaline rush of closing a deal.<br><br> I suppose just occasionally I do feel as though someone&#x2019;s piling heavy weights on me. Like big concrete blocks, one on top of the other, and I have to keep holding them up, no matter how exhausted I am . . .<br><br> But then everyone probably feels like that. It&#x2019;s normal.<br><br> &#x201c;Your skin&#x2019;s very dehydrated.&#x201d; Maya is shaking her head. She runs an expert hand across my cheek and rests her fingers underneath my jaw, looking concerned. &#x201c;Your heart rate&#x2019;s very high. That&#x2019;s not healthy. Are you feeling particularly tense?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Work&#x2019;s pretty busy at the moment.&#x201d; I shrug. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a blip. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; Can we get on with it?<br><br> &#x201c;Well.&#x201d; Maya gets up. She presses a button set in the wall and gentle pan-pipe music fills the air. &#x201c;All I can say is, you&#x2019;ve come to the right place, Samantha. Our aim here is to de-stress, revitalize, and detoxify.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Lovely,&#x201d; I say, only half listening. I&#x2019;ve just remembered that I never got back to David Elldridge about the Ukrainian oil contract. I meant to call him yesterday. Shit.<br><br> &#x201c;Our aim is to provide a haven of tranquility, away from all your day-to-day worries.&#x201d; Maya presses another button in the wall, and the light dims to a muted glow. &#x201c;Before we start,&#x201d; she says softly, &#x201c;do you have any questions?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Actually, I do.&#x201d; I lean forward.<br><br> &#x201c;Good!&#x201d; She beams. &#x201c;Are you curious about today&#x2019;s treatments, or is it something more general?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Could I possibly send a quick e-mail?&#x201d;<br><br> Maya&#x2019;s smile freezes on her face.<br><br> &#x201c;Just quickly,&#x201d; I add. &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t take two secs&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Samantha, Samantha . . .&#x201d; Maya shakes her head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re here to relax. To take a moment for yourself. Not to send e-mails. E-mail&#x2019;s an obsession! An addiction! As evil as alcohol. Or caffeine.&#x201d;<br><br> For goodness sake, I&#x2019;m not obsessed. I mean, that&#x2019;s ridiculous. I check my e-mails about once every . . . thirty seconds, maybe.<br><br> The thing is, a lot can change in thirty seconds.<br><br> &#x201c;And besides, Samantha,&#x201d; Maya goes on. &#x201c;Do you see a computer in this room?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I reply, obediently looking around the dim little room, at posters of yoga positions and a wind chime and a row of crystals arranged on the windowsill.<br><br> &#x201c;This is why we ask that you leave all electronic equipment in the safe. No mobile phones are permitted. No little computers.&#x201d; Maya spreads her arms. &#x201c;This is a retreat. An escape from the world.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; I nod meekly.<br><br> Now is probably not the time to reveal that I have a BlackBerry hidden in my paper knickers.<br><br> &#x201c;So, let&#x2019;s begin.&#x201d; Maya smiles. &#x201c;Lie down, please, under a towel. And remove your watch.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I need my watch!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Another addiction.&#x201d; She tsks reprovingly. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to know the time while you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br><br> She turns away, and with reluctance I take off my watch. Then, a little awkwardly, I arrange myself on the massage table, trying to avoid squashing my precious BlackBerry.<br><br> I did see the rule about no electronic equipment. And I did surrender my Dictaphone. But three hours without a BlackBerry? I mean, what if something came up at the office? What if there was an emergency?<br><br> If they really wanted people to relax, they would let them keep their BlackBerrys and mobile phones, not confiscate them.<br><br> Anyway, she&#x2019;ll never see it under my towel.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to begin with a relaxing foot rub,&#x201d; says Maya, and I feel her smoothing some kind of lotion over my feet. &#x201c;Try to clear your mind.&#x201d;<br><br> I stare dutifully up at the ceiling. Clear mind. My mind is as clear as a transparent . . . glass . . .<br><br> What am I going to do about Elldridge? He&#x2019;ll be waiting for a response. What if he tells the other partners I was lax? What if it affects my chances of partnership?<br><br> I feel a clench of alarm. Now is not the time to leave anything to chance.<br><br> &#x201c;Try to let go of all your thoughts. . . .&#x201d; Maya is chanting. &#x201c;Feel the release of tension. . . .&#x201d;<br><br> Maybe I could send him a very quick e-mail.<br><br> Surreptitiously I reach down and feel the hard corner of my BlackBerry. Gradually I inch it out of my paper knickers. Maya is still massaging my feet, totally oblivious.<br><br> &#x201c;Your body is growing heavy . . . your mind should be emptying . . .&#x201d;<br><br> I edge the BlackBerry up onto my chest until I can just see the sc...</p><h2>For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto</h2><p><p><b>Pocket Edition!</b></p> <p><b>This edition includes an introduction by Lew Rockwell.</b></p> <p>In <em>For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto</em>, Rothbard proposes a once-and-for-all escape from the two major political parties, the ideologies they embrace, and their central plans for using state power against people. Libertarianism is Rothbard's radical alternative that says state power is unworkable and immoral and ought to be curbed and finally abolished. </p> <p>To make his case, Rothbard deploys his entire system of thought: natural law, natural rights, Austrian economics, American history, the theory of the state, and more.</p> <p> It is relentless, scientific, analytical, and morally energetic a book that makes an overwhelming case. Indeed, it gave an entire movement its intellectual consciousness and earned Rothbard the titles "Mr. Libertarian" and "The State's Greatest Living Enemy." </p><p> Society without the nation-state? Rothbard shows that this is the way for peace, prosperity, security, and freedom for all. In the entire history of libertarian ideas, no book has more successfully combined ideological rigor, theoretical exposition, political rhetoric, historical illustration, and strategic acumen. Rothbard poured a lifetime of research and all his intellectual energy into this project and he succeeded in writing a classic. </p><p> The book is the result of the only contract Rothbard ever received from a mainstream commercial publisher. He was asked to sum up the whole of the libertarian creed. Looking at the original manuscript, which was nearly complete after its first draft, it seems that it was a nearly effortless joy for him to write. It is seamless, unrelenting, and full of life. </p><p> He cut no corners and pulled no punches. It appeared in 1973 and created a whole movement that set out to crush the political monopoly. </p><p> From the day the book went out of print, the phone calls and emails started coming into our offices, hopeful of a new edition. Thanks to benefactors who have made it possible, this new edition from the Mises Institute is hardbound, beautiful, and affordable. </p><p> In subject after subject, this book is informative, bracing, and challenging. It also features the characteristically clear writing style for which Rothbard is famous, which stemmed from his organized thinking and passionate drive to teach and change the world. </p><p> The book begins with American history to show that the revolution of 1776 was the most libertarian of any in history. The pastors, pamphleteers, and statesmen who led it held that the state has no rights that the people themselves do not possess. They demanded full liberty, not some truncated version that existed in the old world. In this discussion, the reader comes to appreciate the founders of the United States of America as never before. </p><p> Rothbard then sets out to rekindle that fire, first through a discussion of the philosophy and ethics of freedom. The central axiom: no man or group of men may aggress against the person and property of anyone else. He justifies the axiom on the basis of natural rights. It is an axiom that has few opponents, until Rothbard spells out its implications: taxation is theft, conscription is slavery, and war is mass murder, among many other points. </p><p> Bracing indeed! But the state is the primary violator of this simple axiom. It presumes the right to rob and kill while purporting to protect us from robbing and killing. Thus follows a full theory of the state, how it gains and maintains controls over the population (but not through a social contract !), the various failed methods for keeping it in check (not even constitutions work!), its operations and tendencies to work its evil (it never has enough power), and how intellectuals become co-opted by the forces of state power. </p><p></p></p><p><p> Here again, Rothbard draws his argument from American history. He shows how dangerous it was for the US Constitution to entrust the Supreme Court with the job of policing the government for infractions against the Constitution. What it ended up doing, of course, was ratifying egregious violations of the Constitution, with full knowledge that there was no higher court to which the people themselves could appeal. </p><p> Rothbard isn t satisfied to make his case on this abstract level. He shows that the most pressing problems of society are wrapped up in government operations. Whether it is medical issues, the price of oil, the disaster of education, conflicts over religion, police corruption, or the scandal of war, the issues that are tearing us apart are invariably the result of government intervention into the sector. When markets are in full control whether markets for computer technology and software, or for cell phones we find not conflict but cooperation and progress. </p><p> And so Rothbard demonstrates the failure of government and the triumph of markets in a host of areas: personal liberties, education, welfare, inflation and the business cycle, monopoly and regulation, streets and roads, environmentalism and economic growth, and even police, courts, and law. Nor does he neglect the hugely important areas of trade, war, and foreign policy. He shows that states that are aggressive abroad do not maintain liberty at home. He also pioneers a theory of peace in absence of the state. </p><p> This book is generous with detail on the whole of American history, from the banking debates of the 19th century, through the welfare debate of the 1960s and the controversies over environmental regulation in the 1970s. He shows that the state creates social and economic problems and then further intervenes to make these problems worse then ever while increasing its power at the expense of everyone else. He is particularly good at highlighting who really benefits from government regulation: usually it is the largest corporations who are attempting to rig the game in their favor. </p><p> The anticipated effect of this book on both liberals and conservatives, the Left and the Right, is to force a rethinking of the typical categories. It asks that all sides face their hypocrisies: the Left favors freedom of speech but cares nothing for the private property that guarantees such freedom. The Right demands lower taxes but wages culture wars and real wars that grant government more power to take liberty and property from the American family. </p><p> As you can see, this is a radical and challenging book. We are given not only the big picture or a series of small studies but both at once, fully integrated into an analytical whole. Once you are exposed to the complete picture and <em>For a New Liberty</em> has been the leading means of exposure for more than a quarter of a century you cannot forget it. It becomes the indispensable lens through which to interpret events in the real world with the greatest possible clarity. </p><p> This book more than any other explains why Rothbard seems to grow in stature every year (his influence has vastly risen since his death), why the state continues to regard libertarian ideas as the gravest threat to its power, and why Rothbardianism has so many enemies on the left, right, and center. </p><p> Quite simply, the science of liberty that he brought into clear relief is as thrilling in the hope it creates for a free world as it is unforgiving of the error of power. Its logical and moral consistency, together with its empirical-explanato</p>Murray Rothbard is an economist, historian, political philosopher, iconoclast, and raconteur. He is also a masterful writer--passionate, rigorously logical, and always lively, with a special gift for making even the most complex issues understandable and interesting. <p> <b>For A New Liberty</b> is Rothbard's introduction to libertarianism, his Libertarian Manifesto. It is Rothbard in top form--a libertarian classic that for more than two decades has been hailed as the best general work on libertarianism available. </p><p> For a start, <b>For A New Liberty</b> is an exciting, exhilarating read. It begins with a fast overview of the historical roots of libertarianism: the Levelers, John Locke, classical liberalism, the American Revolution, and so on. Rothbard packs an extraordinary amount of history in a few pages, and establishes libertarianism as the current, and most rigorous and consistent, manifestation of a centuries-long drive for personal and economic liberty. </p><p> Rothbard then defines libertarianism. It rest, he tell us, "upon one single axiom: that no man or group of men shall aggress upon the person or property of anyone else." Having made the philosophical case for liberty, Rothbard--in one of the book's most powerful chapters--turns to a withering critique of the chief violator of liberty: the State. It is a breath-taking, impassioned demolition job. We see that not only is the emperor naked--he is a murder, tyrant, brigand, liar, and bungler. </p><p> Rothbard devotes the lengthiest section of <b>For A New Liberty</b> to showing how the free market and voluntary human action can do a far more efficient and fair job of supplying all the worthwhile services we have been told only government can provide. He provides penetrating libertarian solutions for many of today's most pressing problems, including pollution, poverty, war, threats to civil liberties, the education crisis, and others. </p><p> Libertarians are forever faced with a barrage of questions for the unconverted: What about roads? What about the poor? What about--ad infinitum. Here are tough, succinct, innovative, and convincing answers. -- <i>James W.

He wrote a number of books on business history, management theory, and economic development, including two previous books on the history of Cargill, and the award-winning Mollie Maguires, and John Deere&#39;s Company.</p><h2>Buffy the Vampire Slayer Omnibus, Vol. 2</h2><p>This second volume of our Buffy omnibus series collects many of the best Buffy comics to see print. As we follow the newly-chosen slayer from Los Angeles to Sunnydale and through her parents&#39; divorce - with Dawn in tow - the souled vampire Angel makes his first appearance and the not-so-souled Spike and Drusilla cleave a bloody path towards the West Coast. This collection includes the critically acclaimed graphic novel Ring of Fire and the miniseries A Stake to the Heart, and reflects the Season One to Season Three timeline of the cult-hit TV series. A fitting companion to Joss Whedon&#39;s comics-based relaunch of the show.</p><p></p><h2>We</h2><p>Written in Russia, soon after the Communist Revolution, this story of a universally totalitarian society inspired all the other dystopia novels of the 20th Century (e.g., 1984, Brave New World, Logan&#39;s Run, etc.).</p><p>Before Brave New World... Before 1984... There was We<p>In the One State of the great Benefactor, there are no individuals, only numbers. Life is an ongoing process of mathematical precision, a perfectly balanced equation. Primitive passions and instincts have been subdued. Even nature has been defeated, banished behind the Green Wall. But one frontier remains: outer space. Now, with the creation of the spaceship Integral, that frontier -- and whatever alien species are to be found there -- will be subjugated to the beneficent yoke of reason.</p><p>One number, D-503, chief architect of the Integral, decides to record his thoughts in the final days before the launch for the benefit of less advanced societies. But a chance meeting with the beautiful 1-330 results in an unexpected discovery that threatens everything D-503 believes about himself and the One State. The discovery -- or rediscovery -- of inner space...and that disease the ancients called the soul.</p><p>A page-turning SF adventure, a masterpiece of wit and black humor that accurately predicted the horrors of Stalinism, WE is the classic dystopian novel. Its message of hope and warning is as timely at the end of the twentieth century as it was at the beginning.</p><p>Yevgeny Zamyatin was born in Russia in 1884. Arrested during the abortive 1905 revolution, he was exiled twice from St. Petersburg, then given amnesty in 1913. <em>We,</em> composed in 1920 and 1921, elicited attacks from party-line critics and writers. In 1929, the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers launched an all-out attack against him. Denied the right to publish his work, he requested permission to leave Russia, which Stalin granted in 1931. Zamyatin went to Paris, where he died in 1937.</p><p>Mirra Ginsburg is a distinguished translator of Russian and Yiddish works by such well-known authors as Mikhail Bulgakov, Isaac Babel, Isaac Bashevis Singer, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.

While Dante is a stern moralist, Boccaccio has little time for chastity, pokes fun at crafty, hypocritical clerics and celebrates the power of passion to overcome obstacles and social divisions. Like the Divine Comedy, the Decameron is a towering monument of medieval pre-Renaissance literature, and incorporates certain important elements that are not at once apparent to today&#39;s readers. In a new introduction to this revised edition, which also includes additional explanatory notes, maps, bibliography and indexes, Professor McWilliam shows us Boccaccio for what he is-one of the world&#39;s greatest masters of vivid and exciting prose fiction.</p><p></p><h2>The Queen of Zombie Hearts (White Rabbit Chronicles)</h2><p>I have a plan.&nbsp;<br><br>We'll either destroy them for good, or they'll destroy us.&nbsp;<br><br>Either way, only one of us is walking away.&nbsp;<br><br>In the stunning conclusion to the wildly popular White Rabbit Chronicles, Alice "Ali" Bell thinks the worst is behind her. She's ready to take the next step with boyfriend Cole Holland, the leader of the zombie slayers...until Anima Industries, the agency controlling the zombies, launches a sneak attack, killing four of her friends. It's then she realizes that humans can be more dangerous than monsters...and the worst has only begun.&nbsp;<br><br>As the surviving slayers prepare for war, Ali discovers she, too, can control the zombies...and she isn't the girl she thought she was. She's connected to the woman responsible for killing&#x2014;and turning&#x2014;Cole's mother. How can their relationship endure? As secrets come to light, and more slayers are taken or killed, Ali will fight harder than ever to bring down Anima&#x2014;even sacrificing her own life for those she loves.<br><br>Don't miss FIRSTLIFE, book 1 of Gena Showalter's action-packed, romantic and exhilarating new series, the Everlife novels!</p><p>Gena Showalter is the New York Times and USA TODAY bestselling author of over fifty books, including the acclaimed Lords of the Underworld and Angels of the Dark series, and the White Rabbit Chronicles.

Visit her at GenaShowalter.com."Dude. How about that one?" My best friend, Kat Parker, pointed toward the far corner, to a table occupied by three boys about our age.<br><br>One guy was hot enough to melt a polar vortex. One wasn't handsome in the traditional sense, but with his unusual chartreuse eyes, it hardly mattered. The third was amazingly rugged, with a fresh scrape on his cheek and scars on his knuckles.<br><br>Well, well. We had finally found a smorgasbord of different flavored man-meat.<br><br>"Perfect," I said with a nod.<br><br>"I don't know." Reeve Ankh, my other friend, surveyed the boys and chewed on her bottom lip. "I'm getting danger vibes from the one on the right."<br><br>The one on the right&#x2014;Knuckle Scars. Excellent. Her dan-dar&#x2014;danger radar&#x2014;was working at optimal levels.<br><br>In our little trio, she'd always been the voice of reason. Or, as Kat would say, "the voice of shut up and live a little."<br><br>My darling Kat meant it in the nicest way possible, of course. She simply had no filter. She always spoke her mind, always stood up for what she believed&#x2014;that her way was the best way&#x2014;and lived by the motto I'm On Board the Awesome Train and You Can Hop On or Get Run Over.<br><br>Was it any wonder I loved her so much?<br><br>"This is stupid, you guys."<br><br>The grumble came from Mackenzie Love. Once my archenemy, now one of my favorite pet projects.<br><br>Most people were surprised by our sudden friendship, but I'd learned life could change in the blink of an eye.<br><br><em>Everything</em> could change in the blink of an eye.<br><br>I accepted, and I rolled.<br><br>"Suck it up." Trina Brighton, the last member of our group, kicked Mackenzie under the table. "This was <em>your</em> idea."<br><br>"That's right. You asked for our help, and we agreed to give it to you on one condition. That you do what we say, when we say." Grinning her happy-kitten grin, Kat rubbed her hands together. While I had grown to like Mackenzie, she hadn't. But she <em>had</em> softened...ish. "This is gonna be fun. For me!"<br><br>Hated to admit it, but...yeah, it was gonna be fun for me, too.<br><br>We were at Choco Loco, a chocolate bar where girls picked up treats and boys picked up girls. Not that I wanted to be picked up.<br><br>I'd been going out with the drool-worthy Cole Holland&#x2014;officially...again&#x2014;for a little over a month. And, okay, yeah, there was a slight problem with our relationship. In the course of that month, we'd been on...give me a second to count them&#x2014;zero dates. We'd had a total of...let's see, let's see&#x2014;zero minutes alone. And we'd kissed...oh, I don't know&#x2014;zero times.<br><br>Here are things that suck worse:_.<br><br>Okay, fine. There <em>are</em> a few things that suck worse. Like the time I was an all-you-can-eat dinner buffet for zombies. The time I battled the worst Z-poisoning in the history of ever. And my personal favorite, the time Anima Industries locked me away, electrocuted me, starved me and studied me like a freaking zoo animal.<br><br>Considering all I'd been through, my love life should have been a sparkling diamond in a sea of coal. Or a sea of "Cole." Har har. We had tried to get together, like, plan-everything-down-to-the-last-second tried, but each of our sneak-overs had encountered one teensy-weensy problem.<br><br>Her name: Nana.<br><br>Seriously, my grandmother had morphed into the Make-Out Police, and okay, okay, I didn't really have to rack my brain to figure out why. One night Cole had saved me from a very painful death, and we'd decided to celebrate. Alone. He'd stolen into my bedroom, and we'd done what we always did. (I <em>refuse</em> to provide the down-and-dirty deets. But it was. Down and dirty. <em>Anyway)</em> She'd heard us&#x2014;the horror!&#x2014;and had busted in.<br><br>We'd still had (most of) our clothes on, but yowza, the position she'd caught us in...<br><br>Ever since, Nana has been attached to my side. In fact, the only time she detaches is when I'm hanging with my girls, or when I'm prowling the streets, hunting zombies.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. I love Nana to pieces. And so does Cole. When the three of us get together, we actually have fun. But I want more. I <em>need</em> more. I'm addicted to Cole's hands...and his mouth...and oh, Ali-want, his nipple ring. Withdrawals stink!<br><br>"What are you waiting for, love buns?" Kat banged her hand on the table. "Did I not make it clear that you don't get a vote in this? That the tribe has spoken? You know what you gotta do, so, do it."<br><br>A waiter stepped up to our table before Mackenzie could respond. He set a mousse shooter in front of each of us.<br><br>"Um." Reeve frowned. "We didn't order these."<br><br>"Compliments of the hounds in the corner." A wink, and the waiter was off.<br><br>In unison, my friends and I gazed at our chocolate-addiction enablers. Hot and Chartreuse lifted their own mousse shooters in a toast. Knuckle Scars just stared.<br><br>Reminded me of Cole.<br><br>Kat stood and called, "My friend MacLovin' will come over and thank you in person just as soon as her heartbeat settles. You totally rocked her&#x2014;"<br><br>Mackenzie tugged on her arm, both returning her to her seat and silencing her. "Do you have to be so humiliating?"<br><br>As the toasters high-fived, Kat slapped Mackenzie on the shoulder. "What are you complaining about? We came here to find you a date, and now, thanks to me, it's practically mission accomplished. I've set the stage, so all you have to do is walk over there and pick your favorite boy toy. You're welcome."<br><br>Mackenzie leaned over and bashed her forehead against the table.<br><br>"Why are you acting like such a baby?" Kat gave her another slap. "You're, like, some kind of super ninja warrior who spends her nights catching butterflies and&#x2014;"<br><br>"Good glory," I said. "Stop calling it that."<br><br>"Seriously." Mackenzie stopped bashing and looked up. "You make us sound like&#x2014;" she shuddered "&#x2014;girls."<br><br>Though Kat and Reeve were civilians, not slayers, they knew about the dark, secret world in operation around them. And Kat, well, she now liked to refer to slaying zombies as catching butterflies. She was sweet like that.<br><br>"I'm fine with calling it catching butterflies," Trina said.<br><br>Kat smirked.<br><br>Mackenzie gaped at Trina.<br><br>"What?" Trina shrugged. "I'm confident in my masculinity."<br><br>I snorted. Trina might look like she could lift a bus, but her heart was as soft as marshmallows.<br><br>"You should talk to the boys and get it over with, Mac." Reeve ran her finger over the rim of her shooter and licked away the chocolate. "Kat looks ready to drag you over there."<br><br>"True story," Kat said with a nod. "Just seconds away."<br><br>"If she does," Reeve continued, "the last five minutes will become your happy place."<br><br>"Fine." A scowling Mackenzie pushed to her feet. "But I'm not going to try to charm them."<br><br>"As if you could," Kat said, and Mackenzie's scowl darkened.<br><br>"You've got this in the bag." I truly believed that. Mac wouldn't have to use charm. Not with a face like hers.<br><br>All of my friends had model-perfect faces. And yet, each was so different.<br><br>Kat, with her straight dark hair and hazel eyes, was girl-next-door lovely. Reeve, with her brown waves and doe eyes, was traffic-stopping stunning. Mackenzie, with her black curls and emerald eyes, was child-of-an-angel exquisite. And Trina, with her short spikes and black-rimmed eyes, was punk-rocker cool. I was the oddball, with pale hair and eyes so blue they were freaky.<br><br>As Mackenzie trudged closer to the boys, a shadow fell over our table.<br><br>Kat squealed with delight and threw herself into the arms of the culprit.<br><br>No need to glance over to figure out who had just arrived. Frosty, her on-again, off-again boyfriend.<br><br>They had a weird relationship, because even when they were off, they were on. Like, all-over-each-other on. I'd never seen two people more bat-crap crazy for each other.<br><br>She peppered his face with kisses. "You came!"<br><br>"And you look amazing."<br><br>"Obviously."<br><br>Ha! Such a perfect, confident response. Such a <em>Kat</em> response. I'd have to remember it the next time Cole complimented me.<br><br>"I couldn't stay away." Frosty combed his fingers through Kat's hair. "I believe your last text said, and I quote, 'If you aren't here within the next ten minutes, I will probably forget all about you and fall in love with someone else.'"<br><br>My girl had such a poetic way with words.<br><br>Lucas, as attractive as ever in a polo with the sleeves rolled up to display his dark arms to perfection, stepped out from behind Frosty. He nodded at Trina, peering at her for several seconds beyond polite. A lance of awareness arced between them. Well, <em>well.</em> I'd suspected they were secretly seeing each other, and this just cinched it. Good. They deserved a steamy dose of happiness.<br><br>Kat wrapped her fingers around Frosty's wrist and pulled him closer. "I've always believed open lines of communication are the key to making any relationship work. That, and presents. Do you have one for me?"<br><br>"Me, too!" Reeve waved her hands expectantly. "Gimme."<br><br>Frosty ignored her. As usual, he cared only about his girl. "Shouldn't my exalted presence be present enough? I ditched Cole and Bronx and broke speed records to come snap the spine of anyone who's made a play for you. And since that's surely everyone breathing, I just need you to tell me where you'd like me to start."<br><br>My ears perked at the mention of Cole. "Where'd you leave him?"<br><br>Of course, Frosty ignored me, too.<br><br>"Tatty's Ink," Lucas said. "Bronx is getting Reeve's name inked into his arm. Which, I just remembered, is supposed to be a surprise."<br><br>Reeve cooed happily, thrilled with her boyfriend's unexpected gift.<br><br>I'd decided to get two new tattoos myself, so...why not drive over there <em>now?</em> Cole could hold my hand through the process, and afterward, he'd realize there had never been a more perfect chance for Nana-free time. Two birds, one delectable stone. Afterward, we could...do things. I shivered with anticipation.<br><br>Knowing it would have been criminal to leave a single drop of my mousse shooter behind, I downed it and licked the rim, then licked again just to be safe. I knew I wasn't over-hyping the dessert when I muttered, "This is the best thing in the entire world."<br><br>"Agreed," Reeve said.<br><br>Finally, I made the brave decision to step between Frosty and Kat.<br><br>Yes, other people had been donkey-punched in the throat for doing such a thing, but I was willing to risk it. I needed my best friend's full attention.<br><br>"I'm leaving, and I'm taking Mackenzie with me." Love bug was my ride. "You're not going to have as much fun without me, but I hope you're willing to make the sacrifice."<br><br>Kat pursed her lips. "What about this most special of occasions? Girls' day out."<br><br>Honestly? "It crashed and burned the second Frosty and Lucas showed up."<br><br>"Hey," Frosty said behind me. "I only crash and burn the people who say I crash and burn things."<br><br>"True story." Kat blinked up at me. "But that aside, let's cut through the crap and focus on what you're really saying. I have to choose between him and you."<br><br>If it would save me from having to argue about leaving?<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Oh. Well, then. I choose you," she said with a sunny smile. "Of course."<br><br><em>Should have seen that coming.</em> As much as she loved Frosty, she loved me. Maybe more. We were sisters of the heart rather than blood, and (almost) always put each other's needs above everyone else's.<br><br>"Get lost, Frosty." She made shooing motions over my shoulder. "You can remind me of my affection for you later."<br><br>"But, kitten," he said, his tone beseeching. And it was funny, hearing one of the biggest, baddest Z-killers in Birmingham, Alabama, reduced to begging, all because a tiny fluff of nothing had decided not to play with him. "I have a fever, and the only prescription...is more cow-kat."<br><br>Kat narrowed her eyes at him. "Cow-kat?"<br><br>"Dude," Lucas muttered. "Do you <em>want</em> to lose a testicle?"<br><br>"Okay," Frosty said, "I'm man enough to admit that might have come out wrong."<br><br>I gripped Kat by the shoulders. "You don't have to worry about hurting my feelings. I'm <em>foaming-at-the-mouth eager</em> to see Cole."<br><br>"You planning to make out with him?"<br><br>"Yes," I admitted, even as my cheeks heated.<br><br>"That's so cake. And you'll give me every detail?"<br><br>Wait. "Cake?"<br><br>"My new favorite word, meaning so totally beyond amazeballs."<br><br>Well, okay, then. Soon, it would be the world's favorite. "If you insist, I'll give you a play-by-play." I knew she would.<br><br>She thought for a moment, sighed. "Fine. Go. We'll reschedule."<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>"What can I say? I'm a giver."<br><br>"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times thank you." I kissed her cheek and raced to Mackenzie's side.<br><br>"&#x2014;must be a light switch, because every time I look at you, I'm turned on," Chartreuse was saying.<br><br>No. Just no. Pickup lines were never okay. "We've gotta go," I told her.<br><br>Chartreuse frowned. "But she just got here."<br><br>Relief radiated from Mackenzie. "Sorry, boys. It's been. Yeah." She said no more as <em>she</em> tugged <em>me</em> toward the door.<br><br>"Hey!" Reeve called. "No one said 'bye to me."<br><br>I waved, saying, "'Bye. We love you!" over my shoulder.<br><br>She blew me a kiss.<br><br>Trina laughed at something Lucas said, unconcerned by our departure.<br><br>Mackenzie and I stepped into the wintry afternoon. The sun was shining but the air was chilled. Shoppers wove in and out of nearby boutiques, each lost in their own little worlds.<br><br>"Thank you," Mackenzie said with a shudder. "The only guy I had any interest in never spoke a word to me."<br><br>"Let me guess. Mr. Knuckle Scars."<br><br>"Yeah. How'd you know?"<br><br>"We have similar taste." Proof: we'd both dated Cole. "He would have been my choice, too." And not just for his rugged appeal.<br><br>Every slayer in the war against Z's had lost loved ones to bites and battle wounds, and the sorrow and grief tended to build barriers around our hearts. More and more, it became clear that the strong had a better chance of survival; Knuckle Scars had definitely been the strongest of the bunch.<br><br>Shockingly enough, Frosty&#x2014;who had lost more than most&#x2014;was the exception to my theory. He'd fallen for Kat despite her kidney disease. But I wasn't going to think about her illness and the pain she was&#x2014;and would be&#x2014;forced to endure. I'd break down and be forced to compartmentalize, shoving the heartbreak into a deep, dark corner of my mind, to be dealt with later.<br><br>My compartments were almost full.<br><br>I'd told myself I'd stop doing it, stop locking away the hard emotional crap and finally deal with my feelings, but I'd fallen back into the habit...and honestly, I wasn't in any hurry to change.<br><br>"Where are we going?" Mackenzie settled behind the wheel of her truck. "It's too early for patrol."<br><br>Oh, yeah. We had to patrol for zombies this evening. We'd be with Gavin the man-whore&#x2014;another one of my pet projects, despite his warped sense of humor&#x2014;and the mostly silent Bronx. Time was limited.<br><br>"We're going to Tatty's," I said and explained why.<br><br>"I'd advise you to play a <em>little</em> hard to get, but I swear, it doesn't matter what you do. Cole thinks it's the most adorable thing ever. It makes me want to stab you both in the eye."<br><br>A few weeks ago, she would have spat those words at me like weapons. Because the moment Cole had displayed an interest in me&#x2014;which had been at moment one, thank you very much&#x2014;she'd hated me.<br><br>My sparkling personality had eventually won her over.<br><br></p><h2>The Mysterious Mr Ripley (Crime Monthly)</h2><p>Tom Ripley becomes involved in art forgery, a scheme to defraud an Englishman and his French wife, and a complicated plot involving a shipbuilder&#39;s son</p><p></p><h2>High Performance Habits: How Extraordinary People Become That Way [Paperback] Brendon Burchard</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>Driving Over Lemons: An Optimist in Andalucia</h2><p>A funny, generous, wonderfully written account of an family making a life and home in remote but enchanting southern Spain.<br><br>At seventeen, Chris Stewart, the first drummer for the rock group Genesis, left the band and launched a career that included stints as a sailor, a sheep shearer, and a travel writer. And he has no regrets.<br><br>If he'd become a rock star, he might never have moved with his wife, Ana, to El Valero, a mountain farm in Andaluc�a, Spain, studded with olive, almond, and lemon groves -- but with no access road, water supply, or electricity. He might never have forged the friendship of a lifetime with his resourceful neighbor Domingo. He might never have had the adventures that resulted in both hilarious disasters and blissful serendipity. He might never have experienced the satisfying complexity of a simple life lived in one of Europes's most beautiful regions, among peasants, farmers, ex-pats, New Age travelers, and a growing family, or come to understand a place and its people with such depth and affection. And certainly Stewart, the eternal optimist, would never have written this delectable book and made us his utterly captivated audience.</p><p>When English sheep shearer Chris Stewart (once a drummer for Genesis) bought an isolated farmhouse in the mountains outside of Granada, Spain, he was fully aware that it didn't have electricity, running water, or access to roads. But he had little idea of the headaches and hilarity that would follow (including scorpions, runaway sheep, and the former owner who won't budge). He also had no idea that his memoir about southern Spain would set a standard for literary travel writing. <p> This rip-roaringly funny book about seeking a place in an earthy community of peasants and shepherds gives a realistic sense of the hassles and rewards of foreign relocation. Part of its allure stems from the absence of rose-colored glasses, mainly Stewart's refusal to merely coo about the piece of heaven he's found or to portray all residents as angels. Stewart's hilarious and beautifully written passages are deep in their honest perceptions of the place and the sometimes xenophobic natives, whose reception of the newcomers ranges from warm to gruff.</p><p> After reading about struggles with dialects, animal husbandry, droughts, flooding, and such local rituals as pig slaughters and the rebuilding of bridges, you may not wish to live Chris Stewart's life. But you can't help but admire him and his wife, Ana, for digging out a niche in these far-flung mountains, for successfully befriending the denizens, and for so eloquently and comically telling the truth. The rich, vibrant, and unromanticized candor of <i>Driving over Lemons</i> makes it a laudable standout in a genre too often typified by laughable naivet�. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>"Fortunately, there's no shortage of can-do Brits who are willing to tough it out for the enjoyment of readers everywhere. In fact, the ability to write hilarious travelogues featuring excruciating scenes of discomfort may well be a national characteristic. It's certainly possessed by Chris Stewart, the original drummer for the rock group Genesis, who bought a hovel in Southern Spain and then wrote the beguiling <b>Driving Over Lemons</b>."<br>-- <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"More than a travel book, this is a record of Stewart's slowly flourishing friendship with his neighbor, Domingo, and of how Stewart gradually sank roots deep into his beautiful Andalucian hillside....

There was no doubt whatsoever in his mind about what he had to do. He would not allow anything or anyone to get in his way, and this human boy was standing between him and what he desired. He didn't particularly want to kill the boy; he didn't particularly want the boy alive, either. It was a simple necessity. He didn't feel remorse or regret. As had been the norm during the centuries since he'd fallen, Kalona <i>felt</i> very little. So, indifferently, the winged immortal twisted the boy's neck and put an end to his life.</p><p><i>"No!"</i></p><p>The anguish of that one word froze Kalona's heart. He dropped the boy's lifeless body and whirled around in time to see Zoey racing toward him. Their eyes met. In hers were despair and hatred. In his was an impossible denial. He tried to formulate the words that might make her understand--might make her forgive him. But there was nothing he could say to change what she had seen, and even if he could work the impossible, there was no time.</p><p>Zoey threw the full power of the element spirit at him.</p><p>It hit the immortal, striking him with force that was beyond physical. Spirit was his essence--his core--the element that had sustained him for centuries and with which he had always been most comfortable, as well as most powerful. Zoey's attack seared him. It lifted him with such force that he was hurled over the huge stone wall that separated the vampyres' island and the Gulf of Venice. The icy water engulfed him, smothering him. For an instant the pain within Kalona was so deadening that he didn't fight it. Perhaps he should let this terrible struggle for life and its trappings end. Perhaps, once again, he should allow himself to be vanquished by her. But less than a heartbeat after he had the thought, he <i>felt</i> it. Zoey's soul shattered and, as truly as his fall had carried him from one realm to another, her spirit departed this world.</p><p>The knowledge wounded him worse than had her blow against him.</p><p>Not Zoey! He'd never meant to cause her harm. Even through all of Neferet's machinations, through all of the Tsi Sgili's manipulations and plans, he'd held tight to the knowledge that, in spite of everything, he would use his vast immortal powers to keep Zoey safe because ultimately she was the closest he could come to Nyx in this realm--and this was the only realm left to him.</p><p>Fighting to recover from Zoey's attack, Kalona lifted his massive body from the clutching waves and realized the truth. Because of him, Zoey's spirit was gone, which meant she would die. With his first breath of air, he released a wrenching cry of despair, echoing her last word, <i>"No!"</i></p><p>Had he really believed since his fall that he didn't truly have feelings? He'd been a fool and wrong, so very wrong. Emotions battered him as he flew raggedly just above the waterline, chipping away at his already wounded spirit, raging against him, weakening him, bleeding his soul. With blurred, blackened vision, he stared across the lagoon, squinting to see the lights that heralded land. He'd never make it there. It would have to be the palace. He had no choice. Using the last reserves of his strength, Kalona's wings beat against the frigid air, lifting him over the wall, where he crumpled to the frozen earth.</p><p>He didn't know how long he lay there in the cold darkness of the shattered night as emotions overwhelmed his shaken soul. Somewhere in the far reaches of his mind, he understood the familiarity of what had happened to him. He'd fallen again, only this time it was more in spirit than in body--though his body didn't seem his to command any longer either.</p><p>He felt her presence before she spoke. It had been like that between them from the first, whether he truly wished it or not--they simply sensed one another.</p><p>"You allowed Stark to bear witness to your killing of the boy!" Neferet's voice was more frigid than the winter sea.</p><p>Kalona turned his head so that he could see more than the toe of her stiletto shoe. He looked up at her, blinking to try to clear his vision.</p><p>"Accident." Finding his voice again he managed a rasping whisper. "Zoey should not have been there."</p><p>"Accidents are unacceptable, and I care not one bit that <i>she</i> was there. Actually, the result of what she saw is rather convenient."</p><p>"You know that her soul shattered?" Kalona hated the unnatural weakness in his voice and the strange lethargy in his body almost as much as he hated the effect Neferet's icy beauty had on him.</p><p>"I imagine most of the vampyres on the island know it. Typically for her, Zoey's spirit wasn't exactly quiet in its leave-taking. I wonder, though, how many of the vampyres also felt the blow the chit dealt you just before she departed." Neferet tapped her chin contemplatively with one long, sharp fingernail.</p><p>Kalona remained silent, struggling to center himself and draw together the ragged edges of his torn spirit, but the earth his body pressed against was too real, and he had not the strength to reach above and feed his soul from the wispy vestiges of the Otherworld that floated there.</p><p>"No, I don't imagine any of them felt it," Neferet continued, in her coldest, most calculating voice. "None of them are connected to Darkness, <i>to you,</i> as I am. Is that not so, my love?"</p><p>"We are uniquely connected," Kalona managed, though he suddenly wished the words were not true.</p><p>"Indeed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." she said, still distracted by her thoughts. Then Neferet's eyes widened as a new realization came to her. "I have long wondered how it was that A-ya managed to wound <i>you</i>, such a physically powerful immortal, badly enough that those ridiculous Cherokee hags could entrap you. I believe little Zoey has just provided the answer you've so carefully withheld from me. Your body <i>can</i> be damaged but only through your spirit. Isn't that fascinating?"</p><p>"I will heal." He put as much strength as possible in his voice. "Return me to Capri and the castle there. Take me to the rooft op, as close to the sky as I can be, and I will regain my strength."</p><p>"I imagine you would--were I so inclined to do that. But I have other plans for you, my love." Neferet lifted her arms, extending them over him. As she continued to speak she began weaving her long fingers through the air, creating intricate patterns, like a spider spinning her web. "I will not allow Zoey to interfere with us ever again."</p><p>"A shattered soul is a death sentence. Zoey is no longer any threat to us," he said. With knowing eyes, Kalona watched Neferet. She drew to her a sticky blackness he recognized all too well. He'd spent lifetimes battling that Darkness before he embraced its cold power. It pulsed and fluttered familiarly, restlessly under her fingers. <i>She shouldn't be able to command Darkness so tangibly.</i> The thought drifted like the echo of a death knell through his weary mind. <i>A High Priestess shouldn't have such power.</i></p><p>But Neferet was no longer merely a High Priestess. She had grown beyond the boundaries of that role some time ago, and she had no trouble controlling the writhing blackness she conjured.</p><p><i>She is becoming immortal,</i> Kalona realized, and with the realization, fear joined regret and despair and anger where they already simmered within the fallen Warrior of Nyx.</p><p>"One would think it would be a death sentence," Neferet spoke calmly as she drew more and more of the inky threads to her, "but Zoey has a terribly inconvenient habit of surviving. This time I am going to ensure she dies."</p><p>"Zoey's soul also has a habit of reincarnating," he said, purposefully baiting Neferet to try to throw off her focus.</p><p>"Then I will destroy her over and over again!" Neferet's concentration only increased with the anger his words evoked. The blackness she spun intensified, writhing with swollen power in the air around her.</p><p>"Neferet." He tried to reach her by using her name. "Do you truly understand what it is you are attempting to command?"</p><p>Her gaze met his, and, for the first time, Kalona saw the scarlet stain that nested in the darkness of her eyes. "Of course I do. It's what lesser beings call evil."</p><p>"I am not a lesser being, and I, too, have called it evil."</p><p>"Ah, not for centuries you haven't." Her laughter was vicious. "But it seems lately you've been living too much with shadows from your past instead of reveling in the lovely dark power of the present. I know who is to blame for that."</p><p>With a tremendous effort, Kalona pushed himself to a sitting position.</p><p>"No. I don't want you to move." Neferet flicked one finger at him, and a thread of darkness snaked around his neck, tightened, and jerked him down, pinning him to the ground again.</p><p>"What is it you want of me?" he rasped.</p><p>"I want you to follow Zoey's spirit to the Otherworld and be sure none of her <i>friends</i>"--she sneered the word--"manage to find a way to coax her to rejoin her body."</p><p>Shock jolted through the immortal. "I have been banished by Nyx from the Otherworld. I cannot follow Zoey there."</p><p>"Oh, but you are wrong, my love. You see, you always think too literally. Nyx ousted you--you fell--you cannot return. So you have believed for centuries that is that. Well, <i>you</i> literally cannot." She sighed dramatically as he stared at her blankly. "Your gorgeous body was banished, that's all. Did Nyx say anything about your immortal soul?"</p><p>"She need not say it. If a soul is separated from a body for too long, the body will die."</p><p>"But your body isn't mortal, which means it can be separated indefinitely from its soul without dying," she said.</p><p>Kalona struggled to keep the terror her words filled him with from his expression. "It is true that I cannot die, but that does not mean I will remain undamaged if my spirit leaves my body for too long." <i>I could age .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. go mad .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. become a never dying shell of myself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i> The possibilities swirled through his mind.</p><p>Neferet shrugged.

Why did this shift take place? Was it political gains, cultural momentum, or market forces that energized the evolution and transformation of this cinematic genre?</p><p><i>New Queer Cinema: A Critical Reader</i> provides a definitive and highly readable guide to the development of this important and controversial film movement. The volume is divided into four sections: defining &#x201c;new queer cinema,&#x201d; assessing its filmmakers, examining geographic and national differences, and theorizing spectatorship. Chapters address the work of pivotal directors (such as Todd Haynes and Gregg Araki) and salient films (including <i>Paris is Burning </i>and <i>Boys Don&#x2019;t Cry</i>), as well as unconventional and non-Anglo-American work (experimental filmmaking and third world cinema). </p><p>With a critical eye to its uneasy relationship to the mainstream, <i>New Queer Cinema</i> explores the aesthetic, sociocultural, political, and, necessarily, commercial investments of the movement. It is the first full-length study of recent developments in queer cinema that combines indispensable discussions of central issues with exciting new work by key writers.</p></p><p>MICHELE AARON is lecturer in film studies at Brunel University, London, where she also co-edits the on-line journal <i>EnterText.</i> She is the editor of <i>The Body's Perilous Pleasures: Dangerous Desires and Contemporary Culture</i>.&#34;New Queer Cinema is a very worthwhile, timely project, and Aaron&#39;s informed critical perspective is evidence throughout.&#34;</p><h2>The Vendetta Defense</h2><p><p>Judy Carrier takes the case of her career to defend Anthony Lucia, fondly known as "Pigeon Tony," who freely admits to killing his lifelong enemy in order to settle a personal vendetta. Her client's guilt, however, is only the beginning of Judy's problems. The victim's family wants revenge and is determined to finish off Pigeon Tony and Judy before the case goes to trial. Then there's Pigeon Tony's hunky grandson, who makes Judy think about everything but the law. In a case steeped in blood and memory, it will take brains and a lot of luck to save Pigeon Tony. But if anyone will see justice done, it's this gutsy girl who'll risk everything to win -- including her life.</p></p><p>You can't read past the first chapter of Lisa Scottoline's newest legal thriller without mentally casting the actor who might play Pigeon Tony, the charming and totally authentic defendant who's on trial for killing the man who raped and murdered his wife, destroyed his son and daughter-in-law in a staged "accident," and has threatened the life of his grandson. Robert De Niro's too threatening, Joe Mantegna's too young, Marlon Brando's too fat, but somewhere there must be a celluloid counterpart to one of the most delightful antiheroes in recent crime fiction. Meanwhile, this wonderful character study of a man of conscience on trial for a crime of passion will divert and entertain fans of Scottoline's previous novels about Bennie Rosato's high-estrogen Philadelphia law firm (<i>Moment of Truth</i>, <i>Mistaken Identity</i>). <p> When Judy Carrier, one of Bennie's attorneys, takes on Tony's defense, she's faced with a legal and moral dilemma. Tony admits that he killed Angelo Coluzzi, but insists it wasn't murder but vendetta, a justifiable payback for a blood crime committed nearly half a century ago and a continent away. The Coluzzi family knows about vendetta, too--they've got their own payback planned, and the trick for Judy is keeping Pigeon Tony (and herself) alive long enough to get them to trial. There's a complication <i>de coeur</i> when Judy falls in love with Tony's grandson, a hunky stonemason who will do for fences what Robert James Waller did for covered bridges (Clint Eastwood's too old, Brad Pitt's too young, etc.). But all's well that ends well in a tidy little read that will probably earn Scottoline another well-deserved shot at the bestseller list. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p>Lisa Scottoline is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and serves as president of the Mystery Writers of America.

We imagine the solitary Custer standing upright to the end, his troops formed into groups of wounded and dying men around him. In <i>To Hell with Honor</i>, Larry Sklenar analyzes and interprets the widely accepted facts underlying the popular depiction of Custer&#x2019;s defeat. Approaching the subject with a fresh perspective, he offers wholly new conclusions about one of the most enduring puzzles in United States history--the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Larry Sklenar</strong>, an independent scholar living in Georgetown, South Carolina, is retired from the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>A remarkably detailed and reconstructed account of the era and events surrounding the Seventh Cavalrys infamous loss under General George Armstrong Custer that largely succeeds in ameliorating the Generals equally infamous culpability by exploring the gray areas and forgotten facts of this archetypical American disaster. Sklenar spent six years researching the subject of his debut, and his efforts result in a singular, if dense, verisimilitude. He begins by sketching Custers curious origins, in which his rapid postCivil War rise as a boy general sharply contrasts with the eras downsized, spiritually degraded military. In seeming retreat from Reconstruction, Custers army pursued an increasingly draining series of wars of attrition against various tribes (primarily Sioux and Apache) in the Western territories. Sklenar demonstrates that Custers glory-hungry nature (also depicted as alternatively plucky and foolhardy) meshed badly with a largely weary and resentful officer corps: herein lay the circumstances for the disaster of the Little Bighorn. Sklenar plausibly argues that, while Custer applied strategy according to then-current military doctrine, when faced with a drastically underestimated enemy force of warriors anxious to protect tribal noncombatants, his fate was sealed by an unlucky combination of logistical mishaps and the negligence of officers. Specifically, he explores how Major Reno and Captain Benteen, leading Custers supporting cavalry wings, were motivated respectively by drunken cowardice and long-simmering bitterness in their failure to act after repeated alerts which insured the loss of Custer and his command. They later provided testimony which damned Custer and obfuscated their roles for decades. Sklenar conducts this reappraisal with an admirable depth of factual research, but this, coupled with an often dry prose style, ensures a leisurely pace to his narrative that may prove tedious to casual enquirers into Western lore. However, committed lay readers and serious students of the event and the surrounding Victorian-expansionist milieu will probably find this an engaging, convincing, and fully informative account, one which will stand out in the crowded field of Custer-related books. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Led the Soviets to power in October, 1917. Elected to the head of the Soviet government until 1922, when he retired due to ill health. Lenin, born in 1870, was committed to revolutionary struggle from an early age - his elder brother was hanged for the attempted assassination of Czar Alexander III. In 1891 Lenin passed his Law exam with high honors, whereupon he took to representing the poorest peasantry in Samara. After moving to St. Petersburg in 1893, Lenin's experience with the oppression of the peasantry in Russia, coupled with the revolutionary teachings of G V Plekhanov, guided Lenin to meet with revolutionary groups. On returning to Russia, Lenin and Martov created the League for the Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, uniting the Marxist circles in Petrograd at the time. In the night of December 8, 1895, Lenin and the members of the party are arrested; Lenin sentenced to 15 months in prison. By 1897, when the prison sentence expired, the autocracy appended an additional three year sentence, due to Lenin's continual writing and organising while in prison. Lenin is exiled to the village of Shushenskoye, in Siberia, where he becomes a leading member of the peasant community. Krupskaya is soon also sent into exile for revolutionary activities, and together they work on party organising, the monumental work: The Development of Capitalism in Russia, and the translating of Sidney and Beatrice Webb's Industrial Democracy. After his term of exile ends, Lenin emigrates to M�nich, and is soon joined by Krupskaya. Lenin creates Iskra, in efforts to bring together the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, which had been scattered after the police persecution of the first congress of the party in 1898. [...] After leading the October Revolution, Lenin served as the first and only chairman of the R.S.F.S.R.. In 1919 Lenin founded the Communist International. In 1921 Lenin instituted the NEP. During 1922 Lenin suffered a series of strokes that prevented active work in government. While in his final year &#x2013; late 1922 to 1923 &#x2013; Lenin wrote his last articles where he outlined a programme to fight against the bureaucratization of the Communist Party and the Soviet state. Lenin died on January 21, 1924.</p><h2>Theories for Everything: An Illustrated History of Science</h2><p><i>Theories for Everything</i> highlights the rich, compelling stories behind science's greatest discoveries and the minds and methods that made them possible. Authoritative, entertaining, and easy to follow, it provides indispensable information on our current theories about the natural and physical world as well as a concise overview of how those ideas evolved. <br><br>Filled with illustrations, topical essays, and sidebars, these fascinating pages cover every major topic imaginable&#x2014;astronomy, the human body and its inner workings, the nature of matter and energy, genetics and evolution, and the complex relationship between mind and behavior. Broken down by subject, the book provides readers with a thorough examination of each set of related theories as they are tested and refined and introduces all the major figures in the history of science, including Aristotle, Archimedes, Copernicus, Galileo, Descartes, Pascal, Newton, Edison, Pasteur, Darwin, Pavlov, Curie, Einstein, Freud, Feynman, and Hawking. The lives of more than 45 scientists are captured in special time lines that add depth and detail to the running narrative. <br><br>Each discovery is presented as a detective story: the narrative focuses on how inquisitive investigators posit, revise, and improve upon their descriptions of nature. And like any first-rate mystery, it entices its readers, inviting them to match wits with the scientific sleuths whose theories for everything have unraveled nature's riddles and reshaped how we see our world.</p><p>John Langone was a veteran science journalist and author who had been an editor at both <i>Discover</i> and <i>Time</i> magazines, and a contributor to the science section of the <i>New York Times,</i> as well as a Kennedy Fellow at Harvard, a Fulbright fellow in Tokyo, and a fellow at the Center for the Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford. His previous books for National Geographic were <i>The Mystery of Time</i> and <i>The New How Things Work.</i>Written by seasoned popular-science authors, this typically colorful National Geographic production is a basic introduction to the historical process of science. The late Langone concisely introduces the concept of a theory, emphasizing that it is a general truth about the natural world and not, as in common parlance, a supposition. Definition in hand, the book dives into the oldest science, astronomy, with the most tenaciously held theory, Ptolemy's geocentric cosmos. As with ancient authority in other sciences, such as Galen on human physiology, Ptolemy put curiosity to sleep until Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton formulated testable theories that encompassed larger classes of phenomena. The treatment of the other major sciences likewise emphasizes the gradual overthrow of a reigning theory by a more comprehensive one. Addressing physics, chemistry, geology, biology, and neurology, the authors deploy graphical aids, including time lines, thumbnail biographies, and sidebars, to explain the major theories and figures in each science. With its profusion of illustrations, this is an inviting orientation to the fascinations of science. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This liberal international order has been one of the most successful in history in providing security and prosperity to more people. But in the last decade, the American-led order has been troubled. Some argue that the Bush administration, with its war on terror, invasion of Iraq, and unilateral orientation, undermined this liberal order. Others argue that we are witnessing the end of the American era. <i>Liberal Leviathan</i> engages these debates.</p><br><p> G. John Ikenberry argues that the crisis that besets the American-led order is a crisis of authority. A political struggle has been ignited over the distribution of roles, rights, and authority within the liberal international order. But the deeper logic of liberal order remains alive and well. The forces that have triggered this crisis--the rise of non-Western states such as China, contested norms of sovereignty, and the deepening of economic and security interdependence--have resulted from the successful functioning and expansion of the postwar liberal order, not its breakdown. The liberal international order has encountered crises in the past and evolved as a result. It will do so again.</p><br><p> Ikenberry provides the most systematic statement yet about the theory and practice of the liberal international order, and a forceful message for policymakers, scholars, and general readers about why America must renegotiate its relationship with the rest of the world and pursue a more enlightened strategy--that of the liberal leviathan.</p></p><p><p>"John Ikenberry, Americas leading scholar of international affairs, brilliantly relates theory to historical change in his timely advocacy of a new U.S. foreign policy."--<b>Zbigniew Brzezinski, Center for Strategic and International Studies</b></p><p>"Nobody has thought longer or deeper about the nature of the American liberal world order than John Ikenberry. Tough-minded yet visionary and optimistic, this inspirational volume should become required reading for all those tasked with the great responsibility of steering us to safety through the very choppy international waters into which we are now heading."--<b>Michael Cox, London School of Economics and Political Science</b></p><p>"<i>Liberal Leviathan</i> traces the intimate connections between the emergence of a largely liberal international system and the concentration of global power in the United States in the twentieth century. The marriage of power and principle in the United States has been central to the emergence of the liberal order, but Ikenberry shows that it is also corrosive of that order. As a consequence both of U.S. foreign policy activism and gradual shifts in the distribution of world power, the liberal order faces significant new challenges. This book traces alternative paths through which these challenges might be met."--<b>Barry Posen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"<i>Liberal Leviathan</i> offers a masterful deliberation on American power, international change, and the global order. It will no doubt take its place as a seminal volume in international relations, one that helps define the debate about emerging changes in the global distribution of power.

Krigstein</h2><p>Bernard Krigstein's legend rests mostly on the 30 or so stories he created for the EC Comics, but dozens of stories drawn for publishers such as Atlas (which would become Marvel) showcase his skills and radical reinterpretation of the comics page, in particular his groundbreaking time lapses through a series of narrow, nearly animated panels. Editor Greg Sadowski has assembled the very best of Krigstein's comics work, running through horror, science fiction, war, western, or romance (but no super-heroes). Messages In a Bottle: Comic Book Stories by Bernard Krigstein reprints the out-of-print 2004 hardcover B. Krigstein Comics, with a number of stories re-tooled and improved in terms of reproduction, and several new stories added.<br></p><p><p><strong>Bernard (B.) Krigstein</strong> (1919&#x2013;1990) was trained as a classical painter, but early on he recognized the artistic potential of the comics medium. He was inducted into the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2003.</p><p><strong>Greg Sadowski</strong> is a writer, editor and designer (<em>B. Krigstein</em>, <em>Supermen!, Four Color Fear, Setting the Standard: Alex Toth</em>; <em>Action! Mystery! Thrills!</em>) living in Washington State.</p>Toiling unnoticed in comic books in the late 1940s and &#x2019;50s, Krigstein is now recognized as one of the field&#x2019;s most sophisticated and innovative artists. Although he&#x2019;s best known for his stories for the legendary EC Comics&#x2014;8 of which are included here&#x2014;Krigstein also produced remarkable work for many other publishers, in genres ranging from crime and horror to war and westerns. Although Krigstein was a masterful illustrator (he later abandoned comics for commercial art and canvas painting), capable of varying his style to suit the demands of the story, his genius lay in how he broke down the scripts, using multiple, subdivided panels to audaciously manipulate time. These 41 restored and recolored stories (most of which appeared in the out-of-print B. Krigstein: Comics, 2004) show off his brilliance far better than the cheaply printed comic books where they were first published. Krigstein&#x2019;s thoughtful, intelligent approach to telling a story should be an eye-opener to readers of today&#x2019;s mainstream comic books, which increasingly rely on huge panels filled with vacuous excitement and overblown rendering. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Flashman and the Angel of the Lord</h2><p>Coward, scoundrel, lover and cheat, but there is no better man to go into the jungle with. Join Flashman on his adventures as he survives fearful ordeals and outlandish perils across the four corners of the world. A hasty retreat from the boudoir would normally suffice when caught with a wanton young wife. But when her husband turns out to be a high court judge, a change of continents is called for, as Flashman sets off to America again.</p><p>George MacDonald Fraser OBE was a bestselling historicalnovelist, journalist and screenwriter. Having worked on newspapers in Britain and Canada he is perhaps most famous for his series of Flashman novels and his anti-hero Harry Flashman. In addition to his novels he also wrote numerous screenplays, most notably The Three Musketeers and the James Bond film Octopussy. George MacDonald Fraser died in January 2008 at the age of 82.Roving British Army colonel Sir Harry Flashman, roisterous scoundrel and witty cynic, was a reluctant hero in exploits ranging from the Crimean War (Flashman at the Charge) to China's Taiping Rebellion (Flashman and the Dragon) in nine previous volumes of Fraser's Flashman Papers. In this latest installment, a mesmerizing mix of high adventure, outrageous humor and audacious drama, the cowardly Flashman is kidnapped in Cape Town, South Africa, and sails to Baltimore before being conscripted into abolitionist John Brown's doomed, bloody 1859 raid on a federal arsenal in Harper's Ferry, Va. U.S. government agents enlist Flashman as a spy to dissuade or forcibly prevent Brown from carrying out the raid, fearing that it might trigger civil war. Meanwhile, a band of hooded white supremacists abduct Flashman and order him to abet John Brown's attack, which they believe will unite the South and divide the North. Combining wild imagination, sardonic commentary on American mores and meticulous historical research, Fraser tells a masterful historical tale and presents a magnificent portrait of John Brown as a fearless, autocratic, murderous iron-willed zealot-"a fanatic, yes; a man driven by one burning idea... but never a madman." <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Death and Nightingales</h2><p>It is 1883, and all Ireland&#39;s in turmoil with agrarian, political and sectarian revolt. From the opening of this pastoral of love and betrayal, events roll towards an inevitable, tragic end. Below the surface, complex tensions between religions, between men and women, good and evil are explored.</p><p>Eugene McCabe was born in Glasgow in 1930. His novel Death and Nightingales was published in 1992 to high praise. He has published five collections of short stories, one non-fiction book and a novella. He is also a successful playwright. Eugene McCabe lives in County Monaghan.Originally published in England in 1992, McCabe's powerful, gruffly lyrical novel, released for the first time in America, chronicles the struggles of a spunky, courageous young Irish woman in strife-torn Northern Ireland in the 1880s. Beth Winters enters the world with a strike against her: her mother is Catholic and her father is Protestant. Pregnant at the age of 25, Beth thinks back on the wretched existence of her late mother, Catherine, who was constantly badgered by her violent husband, Billy. Though he could never forgive Catherine for a particularly galling act of betrayal, of which Beth is a constant reminder, Billy conceives a grudging love and admiration for Beth. In moments of weakness, his love takes an unpleasant turn, and Beth is driven toward Liam Ward, a young Catholic who hates Billy for his wealth and power. McCabe, equally adept at scenes of furious action and heated intimacy, never lets the reader forget the Catholic-Protestant violence lying beneath the surface, even in the brutal clashes between father and daughter. Beth herself is acutely aware of the contradictions of her birth and heritage. When she finally steals away after a vicious beating by her father, McCabe cleverly sets up the riveting climax of the book, in which Beth is revealed to be as ruthless as Billy. It is the relationship between father and daughter, charged with a bitterly affectionate love and shared cleverness, that drives this novel, a fine book that rarely blinks at the bitter truths of life, loss and war. (Mar.) Forecast: Known as a playwright in the 1970s, McCabe disappeared from the literary scene in the 1980s, only to return in 1992 with Death and Nightingales, a novel accorded high praise by Colm T�ib�n and Michael Ondaatje. Strong reviews could give McCabe a fresh start in the U.S.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>First Nights: Five Musical Premieres</h2><p>First Nights encourages music lovers to listen to five key masterworks of the Western classical tradition with fresh ears, as if they were attending the premiers themselves. In clear, lively, and engaging prose, Kelly sets the scene for each of these &#34;first nights,&#34; discussing the city, the concert hall, the audience, the composer, the musicians, the instruments, the performance, and the popular and critical response. Extracts from contemporary letters, press reports, account books, and other sources accompany the text in sidebars, along with well-chosen illustrations. These and other documents are quoted in full in separate documentary sections, together with guides to further listening and reading. This book is first and foremost a general-interest book, for people who enjoy going to concerts and listening to recordings, although they may have no formal musical training.</p><p>A successful expansion of his lecture series at Harvard, Thomas Kelly's <i>First Nights</i> chronicles the events leading to the first performances of five enduring masterpieces. He places Monteverdi's opera <i>L'Orfeo</i>, Handel's venerable <i>Messiah</i>, symphonies by Beethoven and Berlioz, and the Stravinsky ballet <i>The Rite of Spring</i> in the respective contexts of the cities, musical cultures, and performance venues in which they were first heard. Kelly builds his chapters through an accumulation of minute but not trivial detail. The first Euridice in <i>L'Orfeo</i> was a castrato priest; the oppression of Catholics in Handel's Dublin was shocking; the legendary catcalls at <i>The Rite of Spring</i>'s premiere began before the curtain went up. <p> As Kelly gathers these pieces of the puzzle together, we become desperate to find out what will happen, completely forgetting that we already know how the music ultimately triumphed over time. Along the way, there is hilarious information about the audiences (Handel's would not have been out of place at a rodeo, though Monteverdi's was unusually well informed) and reactions from the performers (conductor Pierre Monteux apparently always hated the <i>Rite</i>). There are also many factoids about how the music must have sounded. (Did you know that the first performance of Beethoven's Ninth included a piano?) </p><p> Kelly has provocative ideas about performance practice, suggesting that it is really a matter of how adaptable musicians need to be; he feels that musical works themselves, not just our perceptions of them, change over time. A great deal of <i>First Nights</i> is devoted to documents about the works, and the discography is helpfully annotated by Jen-Yen Chen. The book is unusually well designed, and no knowledge of score reading is necessary. <i>--William R. Braun</i></p>Thomas Forrest Kelly is professor of music at Harvard University.

Educated at Berkhamsted School and Balliol College, Oxford, he started his career as a sub-editor of <i>The Times of London. </i>He began to attract notice as a novelist with his fourth book, <i>Orient Express, </i>in 1932. In 1935, he trekked across northern Liberia, his first experience in Africa, recounted in <i>A Journey Without Maps </i>(1936). He converted to Catholicism in 1926, an edifying decision, and reported on religious persecution in Mexico in 1938 in <i>The Lawless Roads, </i>which served as a background for his famous <i>The Power and the Glory</i>, one of several &#x201c;Catholic&#x201d; novels (<i>Brighton Rock, The Heart of the Matter, The End of the Affair). </i>During the war he worked for the British secret service in Sierra Leone; afterward, he began wide-ranging travels as a journalist, which were reflected in novels such as <i>The Quiet American, Our Man in Havana, The Comedians, Travels with My Aunt, The Honorary Consul, The Human Factor, Monsignor Quixote, </i>and <i>The Captain and the Enemy. </i>In addition to his many novels, Graham Greene wrote several collections of short stories, four travel books, six plays, two books of autobiography&#x2014;<i>A Sort of Life </i>and <i>Ways of Escape</i>&#x2014;two biographies, and four books for children.

Snowshoe hares change the color of their coats to protect themselves from predators in the warmer months, they turn brown to match the environment, while during the winter, their coat turns white to blend in with the snow. Mills work shows that as the climate changes, snowshoe hares don t change their coats early enough, often resulting in brown patches on an otherwise snow-white coat. Collard s digestible, clearly written text has enough humorous sidenotes thrown in to make it both entertaining and informative. Full-color photographs, maps, graphs, and topic definitions reinforce the information, and Collard does an excellent job of telling the story of the snowshoe hare, while also keeping stewardship and conservation as the core message.

Long celebrated as a master of the arresting, suggestive image, Transtr�mer is a poet of the liminal: drawn again and again to thresholds of light and of water, the boundaries between man and nature, wakefulness and dream. A deeply spiritual but secular writer, his skepticism about humanity is continually challenged by the implacable renewing power of the natural world. His poems are epiphanies rooted in experience: spare, luminous meditations that his extraordinary images split open&#x2015;exposing something sudden, mysterious, and unforgettable.</p></p><p><b>Tomas Transtr�mer </b>(1933-2015) received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2011. His books of poetry, which have been translated into sixty languages, include <i>The Deleted World</i> and <i>The Half-Finished Heaven</i>, and he received numerous international honors during his lifetime. Transtr�mer, a trained Swedish psychologist, worked for years in state institutions with juveniles and the disabled, and his work was often praised for the inventive ways in which it examined the mind. When he was awarded the Nobel Prize, the Swedish Academy stated that "through his condensed, translucent images, he gave us fresh access to reality."<p>&#x201c;For decades U.S. poets and those in the know have been talking about Transtr�mer, the haunting Swedish poet who's supposedly been on the Nobel shortlist for years. Now that he's actually taken this year's prize, he's no longer a secret. Readers can choose from several selections of poems with different English translators--from New Directions, Ecco, Graywolf, and others--all of which are pretty good, though this little book rushed out by FSG may be the best introduction . . . U.K. poetry star Robertson offers his lucid versions of 15 poems from throughout Transtr�mer's long career, which began in the '50s . . . While readers will certainly be left wanting more pages, the fact that they will is a tribute to Robertson's clear and deep sympathy with Transtr�mer's world.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;His renderings are more fluid when it comes to English syntax than some translations I've read that may be more accurate but are somewhat stilted . . . Robertson has done justice to the greatest qualities of Transtr�mer's poems: their evocative, striking imagery and uncanny metaphorical resonance . . .

Between 1780 and 1813 the Dutch Republic -- a country once rich enough to be called the cash till of Europe and powerful enough to make war with England -- was stripped of its colonies, invaded by its enemies, driven to the edge of bankruptcy, and, finally, reduced to becoming an appendage of the French empire -- an appendage not even the French seemed to value overmuch.

Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form."

Indentured to geisha houses by families in desperate poverty, deprived of freedom and identity, these young women lived in a world of sex for sale, unadorned by the trappings of wealth and celebrity. <br><br>Sayo Masuda has written the first full-length autobiography of a former hot-springs-resort geisha. Masuda was sent to work as a nursemaid at the age of six and then was sold to a geisha house at the age of twelve. In keeping with tradition, she first worked as a servant while training in the arts of dance, song, shamisen, and drum. In 1940, aged sixteen, she made her debut as a geisha.<br><br><i>Autobiography of a Geisha</i> chronicles the harsh life in the geisha house from which Masuda and her "sisters" worked. They were routinely expected to engage in sex for payment, and Masuda's memoir contains a grim account of a geisha's slow death from untreated venereal disease. Upon completion of their indenture, geisha could be left with no means of making a living. Marriage sometimes meant rescue, but the best that most geisha could hope for was to become a man's mistress.<br><br>Masuda also tells of her life after leaving the geisha house, painting a vivid panorama of the grinding poverty of the rural poor in wartime Japan. As she eked out an existence on the margins of Japanese society, earning money in odd jobs and hard labor&#x2015;even falling in with Korean gangsters&#x2015;Masuda experienced first hand the anguish and the fortitude of prostitutes, gangster mistresses, black-market traders, and abandoned mothers struggling to survive in postwar Japan.<br><br>Happiness was always short-lived for Masuda, but she remained compassionate and did what she could to help others; indeed, in sharing her story, she hoped that others might not suffer as she had. Although barely able to write, her years of training in the arts of entertaining made her an accomplished storyteller, and <i>Autobiography of a Geisha</i> is as remarkable for its wit and humor as for its unromanticized candor. It is the superbly told tale of a woman whom fortune never favored yet never defeated.</p><p>Sayo Masuda&#x2019;s <i>Autobiography of a Geisha</i> offers a story of unremitting hardship faced by a hot-springs geisha, a virtual indentured sex-slave in pre-World War II Japan. <p> Born in 1925, Masuda began work as a nursemaid at age 5 and suffered a childhood of emotional and material poverty. She was then sold to the Takenoya geisha house in Upper Suwa at age 12. While her food and clothing were provided for by Takenoya, she was subject to constant verbal abuse as an apprentice. At one point, she was heaved down the stairs by her "Mother" (the name she uses for the proprietor of the geisha house) and nearly lost a leg. During her recovery, she attempted suicide and further injured herself. </p><p> Eventually, Masuda mastered the art of seduction as a geisha. The middle portion of the narrative is taken up with stories of her successful campaign for a <i>danna</i> (patron), of her brother&#x2019;s tragic suicide, and of her star-crossed love affair with a Japanese politician. </p><p> <i>Autobiography of a Geisha</i>, translated for the first time into English by G. G. Rowley, was published in Japan in 1957 and has been in print in Japan steadily ever since. The tale is rendered in a simple English prose to reflect Masuda&#x2019;s own, untrained style (she did not have schooling and she only learned to write hiragana script later in life). For Western readers, Masuda&#x2019;s autobiography is a gift: a glimpse into the dark reality behind one of the most shrouded institutions in Japanese culture. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i></p>Sayo Masuda was a geisha at a hot springs resort, where the realities of sex for sale are unadorned by the trappings of wealth and power. Remarkable for its wit and frankness, the book is a moving record of a woman's survival on the margins of Japanese society&#x2015;in the words of the translator, "the superbly told tale of a woman whom fortune never favored yet never defeated."</p><h2>Thomas Jefferson&#39;s Qur&#39;an: Islam and the Founders</h2><p><p>In this original and illuminating book, Denise A. Spellberg reveals a little-known but crucial dimension of the story of American religious freedom&#x2014;a drama in which Islam played a surprising role. In 1765, eleven years before composing the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson bought a Qur&#x2019;an. This marked only the beginning of his lifelong interest in Islam, and he would go on to acquire numerous books on Middle Eastern languages, history, and travel, taking extensive notes on Islam as it relates to English common law. Jefferson sought to understand Islam notwithstanding his personal disdain for the faith, a sentiment prevalent among his Protestant contemporaries in England and America. But unlike most of them, by 1776 Jefferson could imagine Muslims as future citizens of his new country. <br><br> Based on groundbreaking research, Spellberg compellingly recounts how a handful of the Founders, Jefferson foremost among them, drew upon Enlightenment ideas about the toleration of Muslims (then deemed the ultimate outsiders in Western society) to fashion out of what had been a purely speculative debate a practical foundation for governance in America. In this way, Muslims, who were not even known to exist in the colonies, became the imaginary outer limit for an unprecedented, uniquely American religious pluralism that would also encompass the actual despised minorities of Jews and Catholics. The rancorous public dispute concerning the inclusion of Muslims, for which principle Jefferson&#x2019;s political foes would vilify him to the end of his life, thus became decisive in the Founders&#x2019; ultimate judgment not to establish a Protestant nation, as they might well have done. <br><br> As popular suspicions about Islam persist and the numbers of American Muslim citizenry grow into the millions, Spellberg&#x2019;s revelatory understanding of this radical notion of the Founders is more urgent than ever. <i>Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s Qur&#x2019;an</i> is a timely look at the ideals that existed at our country&#x2019;s creation, and their fundamental implications for our present and future.<br></p></p><p><p>Denise A. Spellberg is an associate professor of history and Middle Eastern studies at the University of Texas at Austin, where she teaches courses on Islamic civilization and Islam in Europe and America.<br></p><p>Introduction<br><br> Imagining the Muslim as Citizen at the Founding of the United States<br> &nbsp;<br> [He] sais &#x201c;neither Pagan nor Mahamedan [Muslim] nor Jew ought to be excluded from the civil rights of the Commonwealth because of his religion.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Thomas Jefferson, quoting John Locke, 1776<br> &nbsp;<br> At a time when most Americans were uninformed, misinformed, or simply afraid of Islam, Thomas Jefferson imagined Muslims as future citizens of his new nation. His engagement with the faith began with the purchase of a Qur&#x2019;an eleven years before he wrote the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson&#x2019;s Qur&#x2019;an survives still in the Library of Congress, serving as a symbol of his and early America&#x2019;s complex relation- ship with Islam and its adherents. That relationship remains of signal importance to this day.<br> &nbsp;<br> That he owned a Qur&#x2019;an reveals Jefferson&#x2019;s interest in the Islamic religion, but it does not explain his support for the rights of Muslims. Jefferson first read about Muslim &#x201c;civil rights&#x201d; in the work of one of his intellectual heroes: the seventeenth-century English philosopher John Locke. Locke had advocated the toleration of Muslims&#x2014;and Jews&#x2014; following in the footsteps of a few others in Europe who had considered the matter for more than a century before him. Jefferson&#x2019;s ideas about Muslim rights must be understood within this older context, a complex set of transatlantic ideas that would continue to evolve most markedly from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amid the interdenominational Christian violence in Europe, some Christians, beginning in the sixteenth century, chose Muslims as the test case for the demarcation of the theoretical boundaries of their toleration for all believers. Because of these European precedents, Muslims also became a part of American debates about religion and the limits of citizenship. As they set about creating a new government in the United States, the American Founders, Protestants all, frequently referred to the adherents of Islam as they contemplated the proper scope of religious freedom and individual rights among the nation&#x2019;s present and potential inhabitants. The founding generation debated whether the United States should be exclusively Protestant or a religiously plural polity. And if the latter, whether political equality&#x2014;the full rights of citizenship, including access to the highest office&#x2014;should extend to non-Protestants. The mention, then, of Muslims as potential citizens of the United States forced the Protestant majority to imagine the parameters of their new society beyond toleration. It obliged them to interrogate the nature of religious freedom: the issue of a &#x201c;religious test&#x201d; in the Constitution, like the ones that would exist at the state level into the nineteenth century; the question of &#x201c;an establishment of religion,&#x201d; potentially of Protestant Christianity; and the meaning and extent of a separation of religion from government.<br> &nbsp;<br> Resistance to the idea of Muslim citizenship was predictable in the eighteenth century. Americans had inherited from Europe almost a millennium of negative distortions of the faith&#x2019;s theological and political character. Given the dominance and popularity of these anti-Islamic representations, it was startling that a few notable Americans not only refused to exclude Muslims, but even imagined a day when they would be citizens of the United States, with full and equal rights. This surprising, uniquely American egalitarian defense of Muslim rights was the logical extension of European precedents already mentioned. Still, on both sides of the Atlantic, such ideas were marginal at best. How, then, did the idea of the Muslim as a citizen with rights survive despite powerful opposition from the outset? And what is the fate of that ideal in the twenty-first century?<br> &nbsp;<br> This book provides a new history of the founding era, one that explains how and why Thomas Jefferson and a handful of others adopted and then moved beyond European ideas about the toleration of Muslims. It should be said at the outset that these exceptional men were not motivated by any inherent appreciation for Islam as a religion. Muslims, for most American Protestants, remained beyond the outer limit of those possessing acceptable beliefs, but they nevertheless became emblems of two competing conceptions of the nation&#x2019;s identity: one essentially preserving the Protestant status quo, and the other fully realizing the pluralism implied in the Revolutionary rhetoric of inalienable and universal rights. Thus while some fought to exclude a group whose inclusion they feared would ultimately portend the undoing of the nation&#x2019;s Protestant character, a pivotal minority, also Protestant, perceiving the ultimate benefit and justice of a religiously plural America, set about defending the rights of future Muslim citizens.<br> &nbsp;<br> They did so, however, not for the sake of actual Muslims, because none were known at the time to live in America. Instead, Jefferson and others defended Muslim rights for the sake of &#x201c;imagined Muslims,&#x201d; the promotion of whose theoretical citizenship would prove the true universality of American rights. Indeed, this defense of imagined Muslims would also create political room to consider the rights of other despised minorities whose numbers in America, though small, were quite real, namely Jews and Catholics. Although it was Muslims who embodied the ideal of inclusion, Jews and Catholics were often linked to them in early American debates, as Jefferson and others fought for the rights of all non-Protestants.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1783, the year of the nation&#x2019;s official independence from Great Britain, George Washington wrote to recent Irish Catholic immigrants in New York City. The American Catholic minority of roughly twenty- five thousand then had few legal protections in any state and, because of their faith, no right to hold political office in New York. Washing- ton insisted that &#x201c;the bosom of America&#x201d; was &#x201c;open to receive . . . the oppressed and the persecuted of all Nations and Religions; whom we shall welcome to a participation of all our rights and privileges.&#x201d; He would also write similar missives to Jewish communities, whose total population numbered only about two thousand at this time.<br> &nbsp;<br> One year later, in 1784, Washington theoretically enfolded Muslims into his private world at Mount Vernon. In a letter to a friend seeking a carpenter and bricklayer to help at his Virginia home, he explained that the workers&#x2019; beliefs&#x2014;or lack thereof&#x2014;mattered not at all: &#x201c;If they are good workmen, they may be of Asia, Africa, or Europe. They may be Mahometans [Muslims], Jews or Christian of an[y] Sect, or they may be Atheists.&#x201d; Clearly, Muslims were part of Washington&#x2019;s understanding of religious pluralism&#x2014;at least in theory. But he would not have actually expected any Muslim applicants.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although we have since learned that there were in fact Muslims resident in eighteenth-century America, this book demonstrates that the Founders and their generational peers never knew it. Thus their Muslim constituency remained an imagined, future one. But the fact that both Washington and Jefferson attached to it such symbolic significance is not accidental. Both men were heir to the same pair of opposing European traditions.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first, which predominated, depicted Islam as the antithesis of the &#x201c;true faith&#x201d; of Protestant Christianity, as well as the source of tyrannical governments abroad. To tolerate Muslims&#x2014;to accept them as part of a majority Protestant Christian society&#x2014;was to welcome people who professed a faith most eighteenth-century Europeans and Americans believed false, foreign, and threatening. Catholics would be similarly characterized in American Protestant founding discourse. Indeed, their faith, like Islam, would be deemed a source of tyranny and thus antithetical to American ideas of liberty.<br> &nbsp;<br> In order to counter such fears, Jefferson and other supporters of non-Protestant citizenship drew upon a second, less popular but crucial stream of European thought, one that posited the toleration of Muslims as well as Jews and Catholics. Those few Europeans, both Catholic and Protestant, who first espoused such ideas in the sixteenth century often died for them. In the seventeenth century, those who advocated universal religious toleration frequently suffered death or imprisonment, banishment or exile, the elites and common folk alike. The ranks of these so-called heretics in Europe included Catholic and Protestant peasants, Protestant scholars of religion and political theory, and fervid Protestant dissenters, such as the first English Baptists&#x2014;but no people of political power or prominence. Despite not being organized, this minority consistently opposed their coreligionists by defending theoretical Muslims from persecution in Christian-majority states.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a member of the eighteenth-century Anglican establishment and a prominent political leader in Virginia, Jefferson represented a different sort of proponent for ideas that had long been the hallmark of dissident victims of persecution and exile. Because of his elite status, his own endorsement of Muslim citizenship demanded serious consideration in Virginia&#x2014;and the new nation. Together with a handful of like-minded American Protestants, he advanced a new, previously unthinkable national blueprint. Thus did ideas long on the fringe of European thought flow into the mainstream of American political dis- course at its inception.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not that these ideas found universal welcome. Even a man of Jefferson&#x2019;s national reputation would be attacked by his political opponents for his insistence that the rights of all believers should be protected from government interference and persecution. But he drew support from a broad range of constituencies, including Anglicans (or Episcopalians), as well as dissenting Presbyterians and Baptists, who suffered persecution perpetrated by fellow Protestants. No denomination had a unanimously positive view of non-Protestants as full American citizens, yet support for Muslim rights was expressed by some members of each.<br> &nbsp;<br> What the supporters of Muslim rights were proposing was extraordinary even at a purely theoretical level in the eighteenth century. American citizenship&#x2014;which had embraced only free, white, male Protestants&#x2014;was in effect to be abstracted from religion. Race and gender would continue as barriers, but not so faith. Legislation in Virginia would be just the beginning, the First Amendment far from the end of the story; in fact, Jefferson, Washington, and James Madison would work toward this ideal of separation throughout their entire political lives, ultimately leaving it to others to carry on and finish the job. This book documents, for the first time, how Jefferson and others, despite their negative, often incorrect understandings of Islam, pursued that ideal by advocating the rights of Muslims and all non-Protestants.<br> &nbsp;<br> A decade before George Washington signaled openness to Muslim laborers in 1784 he had listed two slave women from West Africa among his taxable property. &#x201c;Fatimer&#x201d; and &#x201c;Little Fatimer&#x201d; were a mother and daughter&#x2014;both indubitably named after the Prophet Muhammad&#x2019;s daughter Fatima (d. 632). Washington advocated Muslim rights, never realizing that as a slaveholder he was denying Muslims in his own midst any rights at all, including the right to practice their faith. This tragic irony may well have also recurred on the plantations of Jefferson and Madison, although proof of their slaves&#x2019; religion remains less than definitive. Nevertheless, having been seized and transported from West Africa, the first American Muslims may have numbered in the tens of thousands, a population certainly greater than the resident Jews and possibly even the Catholics. Although some have speculated that a few former Muslim slaves may have served in the Continental Army, there is little direct evidence any practiced Islam and none that these individuals were known to the Founders. In any case, they had no influence on later political debates about Muslim citizenship.<br> &nbsp;<br> The insuperable facts of race and slavery rendered invisible the very believers whose freedoms men like Jefferson, Washington, and Madison defended, and whose ancestors had resided in America since the seventeenth century, as long as Protestants had. Indeed, when the Founders imagined future Muslim citizens, they presumably imagined them as white, because by the 1790s &#x201c;full American citizenship could be claimed by any free, white immigrant, regardless of ethnicity or religious beliefs.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The two actual Muslims Jefferson would wittingly meet during his lifetime were not black West African slaves but North African ambassadors of Turkish descent. They may have appeared to him to have more melanin than he did, but he never commented on their complexions or race. (Other observers either failed to mention it or simply affirmed that the ambassador in question was not black.) But then Jefferson was interested in neither diplomat for reasons of religion or race; he engaged them because of their political power. (They were, of course, also free.)<br> &nbsp;<br> But even earlier in his political life&#x2014;as an ambassador, secretary of state, and vice president&#x2014;Jefferson had never perceived a predominantly religious dimension to the conflict with North African Muslim powers, whose pirates threatened American shipping in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic. As this book demonstrates, Jefferson as president would insist to the rulers of Tripoli and Tunis that his nation harbored no anti-Islamic bias, even going so far as to express the extraordinary claim of believing in the same God as those men.<br> &nbsp;<br> The equality of believers that Jefferson sought at home was the same one he professed abroad, in both contexts attempting to divorce religion from politics, or so it seemed. In fact, Jefferson&#x2019;s limited but unique appreciation for Islam appears as a minor but active element in his presidential foreign policy with North Africa&#x2014;and his most personal Deist and Unitarian beliefs. The two were quite possibly entwined, with their source Jefferson&#x2019;s unsophisticated yet effective understanding of the Qur&#x2019;an he owned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, as a man of his time, Jefferson was not immune to negative feelings about Islam. He would even use some of the most popular anti- Islamic images inherited from Europe to drive his early political arguments about the separation of religion from government in Virginia. Yet ultimately Jefferson and others not as well known were still able to divorce the idea of Muslim citizenship from their dislike of Islam, as they forged an &#x201c;imagined political community,&#x201d; inclusive beyond all precedent.<br> &nbsp;<br> The clash between principle and prejudice that Jefferson himself overcame in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries remains a test for the nation in the twenty-first. Since the late nineteenth century, the United States has in fact become home to a diverse and dynamic American Muslim citizenry, but this population has never been fully welcomed. Whereas in Jefferson&#x2019;s time organized prejudice against Muslims was exercised against an exclusively foreign and imaginary nonresident population, today politic...</p></p><h2>Funny Money</h2><p>Recounts the dazzling heydey and precipitous collapse of Oklahoma&#39;s Penn Square Bank and focuses on the colorful personalities of the financial wheelers and dealers and gas and oil speculators involved</p><p>Mark Singer has been a staff writer for The New Yorker since 1974.

Once again, the animals are concocting their favorite brew of pumpkin soup when they realize that they've run out of salt. Cat announces that he's going shopping when directionally challenged, but headstrong little Duck insists on accompanying him. Cat relents only after Duck promises to hold on tight to avoid getting lost. A concerned Squirrel decides to bring up the rear on the trip to the city. With his friends on either side, Duck spies a pepper shop and decides that the flavoring would be a delicious addition to their soup. Squirrel begs to differ and he and Cat steam off in the direction of the salt shop, unknowingly leaving their distracted friend behind.

Her reasons mix humility with a conviction that prayer is simple: books about prayer can be a dangerous distraction. Yet, when she does speak about prayer, often in response to the questions of ordinary people, she does so with an eloquence that speaks directly to her hearers in ways that make practical sense. Now, in her older age, Sister Wendy is willing to set down some of what she has learnt over a lifetime in a series of meditations. The format of the book is deliberately non-linear: where prayer is concerned, Sister Wendy says, it is simply a matter of trying to turn to God as honestly as the person you are in the circumstances you find yourself in. Her co-author, David Willcock, who has worked with Sister Wendy for many years producing her television programmes, adds to her text a biographical sketch about being a nun and at the same time one of the art world&#39;s most acute and revered commentators and a TV personality. Illustrating this unique book are a dozen pieces of artwork: no book by Sister Wendy would be complete without this dimension.</p><p>Sister Wendy became a nun at the age of 16, went on to live for nearly 20 years as a hermit, and then was exposed to the world in a successful television career as the &#39;art nun&#39;. She is the author of over 20 books with art as the main theme. She continues to live a largely cloistered life, devoted to prayer.One<br><br>The Practice of Prayer<br><br>Do You Want to Pray?<br><br>One year--I forget the details--the Lenten sermons at Saint Patrick's in New York were given by a famous Jesuit who took prayer for his theme. He was much admired, but the compliment that stuck in his memory was that of an old priest who seemed to regard the very number and length of his sermons as constituting, per se, a sort of brilliant tour de force. "Because as you know, Father," he said, dropping his voice conspiratorially, "prayer's the simplest thing out." I hope the famous Jesuit did know, because the simplicity of prayer, its sheer, terrifying uncomplicatedness, seems to be the last thing most of us either know or want to know.<br><br>It is not difficult to intellectualize about prayer. Like love, beauty and motherhood, it quickly sets our eloquence aflow. It is not difficult, but it is perfectly futile. In fact, those glowing pages on prayer are worse than futile; they can be positively harmful. Writing about prayer, reading about prayer, talking about prayer, thinking about prayer, longing for prayer and wrapping myself more and more in these great cloudy sublimities can make me feel so aware of the spiritual--anything rather than actually praying. What am I doing but erecting a screen behind which I can safely maintain my self-esteem and hide away from God?<br><br>Ask yourself: what do I really want when I pray? Do you want to be possessed by God? Or to put the same question more honestly, do you want to want it? Then you have it. The one point Jesus stressed and repeated and brought up again is, "Whatever you ask the Father, He will grant it to you." His insistence on faith and perseverance are surely other ways of saying the same thing: you must really want, it must engross you. Wants that are passing, faint emotional desires that you do not press with burning conviction, these are things you do not ask "in Jesus' name"; how could you? But what you really want, "with all your heart and soul and mind and strength," that Jesus pledges himself to see that you are granted. He is not talking only, probably not even primarily, of prayer of petition, but of prayer. When you set yourself down to pray, what do you want? If you want God to take possession of you, then you are praying. That is all prayer is.<br><br>The astonishing thing about prayer is our inability to accept that if we have need of it, as we do, then because of God's goodness, it cannot be something that is difficult. Accept that God is good and that your relationship with Him is prayer, and you must conclude that prayer is an act of the utmost simplicity. Yet so many people seem to feel that there is some mysterious method, some way in that others know, but they do not. "Knock and it shall be opened to you," but they seem to believe that it needs some sort of Masonic knock and their own humble tapping will go unnoticed. What kind of God thinks of tricks, lays down arcane rules, makes things difficult? God wants to love us and to give Himself. He wants to draw us to Himself, strengthen us, and infuse His peace. The humblest, most modest, almost imperceptible rubbing of our fingers on the door, and it flies open.<br><br>Prayer is the last thing we should feel discouraged about. It concerns nobody except God--always longing only to give Himself to us in love--and our own decision. And that, too, is God's, "who works in us to will and to effect." In a very true sense, there is nothing more to say about prayer, "the simplest thing out."<br><br>God's Business<br><br>Some artists seem to me, whether consciously or not, to use images that speak of the mystery of God. Craigie Aitchison is one. A favorite theme is the holy island of Lindisfarne seen across water, but here we feel the waters are not geographical (figure 1).<br><br>This boat sails on no specific sea, but on those mythic waters that have always been our image of the mysterious unknown of living. This is not an earthly sky, any more than this is an earthly sea. The small boat, its sail taut, does not reveal who is within it. Below our curious gaze, the sailor lies hidden. This boat that seemingly sails by itself can be seen to speak of prayer.<br><br>When we pray, we are likewise carried, borne along by a power that we do not and cannot direct. It is our prayer, our boat. It is we who have launched it on this sea of faith and we who stay quiet within it. But all the movement comes from God. We await Him, we surrender to Him. Where we want to go is not to the point; it is where God wants to take us. We do not see where that is. There is starlight, yes, but no sun or moon, no clarity of vision. Our world becomes duotone: scarlet sky, purple sea. All that is in our power is choice (as it is in life, which is meant to be prayer extended): do we stay still, hidden, unable to take control, or do we jump up and steer that boat ourselves, refusing God's lordship?<br><br>Put like that, it seems so obvious, yet it can be very hard to stay in this state of powerlessness, of blindness, of vulnerability accepted, when all that holds us motionless in the boat is our trust in God. But prayer is impossible without trust. We give our time and attention only and wholly because we believe that it is Jesus who prays within us. It is He who is united to His Father and we who live in Him--and so with that divine Father. We may not feel that, or on the contrary, it may be the overwhelming certainty on which all we are is centered. Feeling or nonfeeling are equally unimportant. What matters is to stay at rest in the boat, down below sight level, while the wind that is the Holy Spirit bears us over the still waters to where the Father waits for us. "For the Son of God . . . was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes. For all the promises of God find their Yes in him" (2 Corinthians 1:19-20). Boat is the closest expression I have seen of making visual that sacred "Yes."<br><br>Your Unique Prayer<br><br>Prayer does not depend upon your natural capacity. What does depend upon your natural capacity is the kind of prayer, because it will be your prayer. But prayer itself is as simple as conversation between friends. No one would dare write a book on how husband and wife are to talk to each other--what topics are appropriate, what tone should be used--because obviously every marriage is different and goes through different phases. One of the responsibilities of any close relationship is that each person has to take seriously his or her need to talk, share, discuss and love. And this need will continually be changing. In prayer the relationship is between God and ourselves. God is always the same, but each of us is completely different.<br><br>The essential act of prayer is to stand unprotected before God. What will God do? He will take possession of us. That He should do this is the whole purpose of life. We know we belong to God; we know too, if we are honest, that almost despite ourselves, we keep a deathly hold on our own autonomy. We are willing, in fact very ready, to pay God lip service (just as we are ready to talk prayer rather than to pray), because waving God as a banner keeps our conscience quiet. But really to belong to God is another matter. It means having nothing left for ourselves, always bound to the will of Another, no sense of interior success to comfort us, living in the painful acknowledgement of being "unprofitable servants."<br><br>It is a terrible thing to be a fallen creature, and for most of the time we busily push this truth out of our awareness. But prayer places us helpless before God, and we taste the full bitterness of what we are. "Our God is a consuming fire," and my filth crackles as He seizes hold of me; He "is all light," and my darkness shrivels under His blaze. It is this naked blaze of God that makes prayer so terrible. For most of the time we can convince ourselves that we are good enough, good as the next man or woman--perhaps even better--who knows? Then we come to prayer--real prayer, unprotected prayer--and there is nothing left in us, no ground on which to stand.<br><br>Normally, as we grow older, we become progressively skilled in coping with life. In most departments, we acquire techniques on which we can fall back when interest and attention wilt. It is part of maturity that there is always some reserve we can tap. But this is not so in prayer. It is the only human activity that depends totally and solely on its intrinsic truth. We are there before God, or rather, to the degree that we are there before God, we are exposed to all that He is, and He can neither deceive nor be deceived. It is not that we want to deceive, whether God or anybody else, but with other people we cannot help our human condition of obscurity. We are not wholly there for them, nor they for us. We are simply not able to be so. Nor should we be. No human occasion calls for our total presence, even were it within our power to offer it. But prayer calls for it. Prayer is prayer if we want it to be.<br><br>Hunger for God<br><br>Saint Teresa of Avila, that great writer on prayer (a doctor of the Church solely because of what she said about prayer), never wearied of contemplating the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman from Saint John's Gospel. It summed up for her what prayer was all about. And I am sorry that she would never have known far away in Spain of this great picture by Duccio, part of his masterwork for the cathedral in Siena (figure 2).<br><br>Duccio shows us an image of prayer, of the need and the hunger for God. The apostles have gone into the city to satisfy their hunger. They emerge in a compact bunch, supporting one another, protected from the clear light of His presence by the fortress of the world, their own self-sufficiency.<br><br>Their hands are full, they clasp them to themselves, satisfied hands with the food of this world in their grasp. But the woman stands alone and exposed before Jesus. Her emptiness is seen not only in her hands, but in the most noticeable detail about her, which is the large empty pot on...</p><h2>Once Upon a Time in the North</h2><p><b><b><b><b><b><i>*****&nbsp;</i>THE BOOK OF DUST,<i>&nbsp;the long-awaited new novel from Philip Pullman set in the world of His Dark Materials, has been<b><b><i><b><b><b><i>&nbsp;hailed by the New York Times as "A stunning achievement"*****</i></b></b></b></i></b></b></i></b></b></b></b><br></b><br>In this prequel episode from Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials universe, Lee Scoresby--Texan aeronaut and future friend to Lyra Belacqua--is just 24 years old, and he's recently won his hot-air balloon in a poker game.

By the author of Days Between Stations.</p><p>God invented millennia for writers like Steve Erickson. Erickson's previous books have buried L.A.'s freeways in sand, set bonfires in Paris streets, and hitched along for the 1996 presidential campaign. In terms of madness, doom, and sheer human folly, what could possibly be left? Plenty, as it turns out. As <i>The Sea Came in at Midnight</i> opens, 17-year-old Kristin works in a Japanese "memory hotel," where despite her so-so looks she's in high demand. As an American, "Kristin represents the Western annihilation of ancient Japanese memory and therefore its master and possessor, a red bomb in one hand, a red bottle of soda pop in the other." After one of her best clients expires in the booth, she finally tells him her own story--which turns out to be quite a tale, involving escape from a millennial suicide cult and nude solitary confinement at the behest of a man known only as the Occupant. Add in the novel's other threads, which span 40 years and include a dream cartographer, a chaos-based calendar, time capsules, and both real and faked snuff films, and you have a heady mixture indeed. Fans of Erickson's unsettling, dreamlike style are legion, and they won't be disappointed in his latest take on the End Time, Blade Runner-style. But in a way, the millennium is beside the point; with a plot like this one, a mere flipping of digits seems so much apocalyptic icing on the cake. Combing a lyrical surrealism with a jittery, jump-cut technique, Erickson writes like the 21st-century heir of Pynchon and DeLillo. <i>--Chloe Byrne</i>Steve Erickson's previous novels, including <i>Days Between Stations</i>, <i>Rubicon Beach</i>, <i>Tours of the Black Clock</i>, <i>Arc d'X</i> and <i>Amnesiascope</i>, have been published in ten languages throughout Europe and Asia, and his work has appeared in such magazines and journals as Esquire, Elle, Rolling Stone, Spin, San Francisco, Conjunctions and Salon.</p><h2>Delilah</h2><p>Excerpt from Delilah<br><br>Down the narrow convexity of the main deck - it really was like the back of a thin whale - stretched in single file the external structures 1ndispensable to Delilah's purposes and func tions. First came the short, formidable, stream-lined Smoke stack Number One, leaning backward toward the stern as if unable to meet upright the strain of Delilah's fierce, forward leaps. Back of the stack, side by side, came the two capacious nostrils of the big blowers that sucked a heavy pressure of air down into the Forward F ire-room. Between these was the air-tight little hatch that provided the only access to this fire room. Next came Smokestack Number Two, precisely similar to the first and succeeding stacks, and after that the rectangular hatch of the Starboard Engine-room, echeloned to port of which was the hatch Of the Port Engine-room. It was not mere coincidence that Lieutenant Fitzpatrick was sending his longing glances staggering up towards the fresh, blue mirage framed in the Starboard Engine-room Hatchway, while Ensign Snell was glancing up as desirously at that framed in the Port; for as Fitzpatrick was senior to, and took precedence over Snell, so the starboard engine took precedence over, and set the pace for the port engine.<br><br>About the Publisher<br><br>Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Goldwater's charm and sense of humor are in evidence throughout this plain-talk autobiography, written with Casserly ( The Ford White House ), and so is his orneriness. Former defense secretary Robert McNamara comes in for a drubbing over his numbers-game approach to the Vietnam war, for instance, and the senator pulls no punches in his discussion of Richard Nixon's "long record of political treachery." Nor has he forgotten Bill Moyers's anti-Goldwater ads during the 1964 presidential campaign, calling them "the beginning of 'electronic dirt.' " The media, he grumbles, has since then become the fourth branch of government.

Yet, while history remembers the women of the convention, it has all but forgotten Sarah Polk. Now, in her riveting biography, Amy S. Greenberg brings Sarah&#x2019;s story into vivid focus. We see Sarah as the daughter of a frontiersman who raised her to discuss politics and business with men; we see the savvy and charm she brandished in order to help her brilliant but unlikeable husband, James K. Polk, ascend to the White House. We watch as she exercises truly extraordinary power as First Lady: quietly manipulating elected officials, shaping foreign policy, and directing a campaign in support of America&#x2019;s expansionist war against Mexico. And we meet many of the enslaved men and women whose difficult labor made Sarah&#x2019;s political success possible.<br><br> Sarah Polk&#x2019;s life spanned nearly the entirety of the nineteenth-century. But her own legacy, which profoundly transformed the South, continues to endure. Comprehensive, nuanced, and brimming with invaluable insight, <i>Lady First </i>is a revelation of our twelfth First Lady&#x2019;s complex but essential part in American feminism.</p><p>Amy S. Greenberg is the George Winfree Professor of History and Women's Studies at Penn State University. A leading scholar of the history of nineteenth-century America, she has held fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the American Philosophical Society, among others. Her previous books include <i>A Wicked War</i> and <i>Manifest Manhood</i>.<b>Preface</b><br><br>Mrs. Polk's 1848<br>History can be capricious, as the following story about two events and one exceptionally powerful woman should make clear. For the twenty-three million residents of the United States and the seven and a half million residents of Mexico, the landmark event of 1848 was the ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended a twenty-month-long war between the two countries, and transferred approximately half of Mexico&#x2019;s prewar territory to the United States. Although the war left thirteen thousand Americans and at least twenty-five thousand Mexicans dead, and the contested status of slavery in the newly acquired territories, including California and New Mexico, was already provoking threats of secession in the South, it was recognized at the time as a remarkable victory for both the United States and that exceptionally powerful American woman. Her name was Sarah Childress Polk, and the defeat of Mexico was her reward for years of labor alongside her husband in the name of America&#x2019;s &#x201c;Manifest Destiny.&#x201d; <br><br>President James K. Polk, a taciturn fifty-two-year-old left prematurely aged by compulsive work habits and chronic intestinal complaints, emerged from the war admired by some but loved by very few other than his wife. Humorless and secretive, he lied to members of his own party, to Congress, and to the American people. The war was divisive; antiwar agitators across the country condemned the president for prosecuting an immoral war, and the nation turned against his political party, the Democrats. The opposition party, the Whigs, easily won the presidency that year with a war hero, General Zachary Taylor, as their candidate. <br><br>But forty-four-year-old Sarah Polk, a slim, elegantly dressed woman whose vivacity, youthfulness, and ability to charm formed a perfect contrast to her husband, suffered no such backlash from the war that she helped promote. On one hand this is entirely unsurprising. An age-old set of assumptions enforced by both law and custom proclaimed women un t for public life. They weren&#x2019;t citizens, and they couldn&#x2019;t vote. If they were married, their identities were legally subsumed into those of their husbands. That even rich, well-educated white women like Mrs. James K. Polk were biologically and socially incapable of contemplating matters such as foreign policy was for most Americans an assumption so obvious as to go entirely unquestioned. <br><br>Were a woman intellectually capable of engaging with affairs of state, American politics was utterly unwelcoming for the &#x201c;gentle sex.&#x201d; Americans were justly proud of their democratic institutions, but those institutions were competitive, coercive, and quite liable to turn violent. Men physically fought over political positions, while partisans fueled by free alcohol attacked one another at the polls. The wrong political statement, put into print, could result in a challenge to a duel, or a surprise attack in the streets. Election-day riots were sadly common. This was considered no space for women. <br><br>There was little debate over this point because America&#x2019;s men and women agreed that the two sexes were suited to different spheres. Men belonged in the political, competitive, public world of work and elections, and women in the peaceful, religious, domestic realm of children and home. Women who crossed this line and insisted on openly expressing their political views did so at their own peril. The abolitionist Grimk� sisters became notorious in the 1830s for insisting on speaking in public, and were threatened with death by angry mobs. This was the reality of women&#x2019;s lives in 1848. <br><br>Yet somehow Mrs. James K. Polk managed to stand above the constraints that bound other women. Her views on the Manifest Destiny of the United States were well known, as were her political efforts in support of her husband. Indeed, her dedication to her husband&#x2019;s agenda, and the fact that the two were a seemingly inseparable team, was a large part of her appeal as a First Lady. <br><br>In 1848 she was the most powerful woman in America. She controlled access to her husband and helped coordinate the Democratic Party&#x2019;s political agenda. She managed her husband&#x2019;s political campaigns and negotiated on his behalf with men who understood her value as a conduit. No accident, her power was grounded in decades of work as a political spouse, her remarkable powers of innovation, a deep and abiding love of politics, and the unpaid labor of dozens of enslaved people who toiled for her in her home and on a cotton plantation. As a marital partner and her husband&#x2019;s closest advisor, Mrs. James K. Polk (the name she preferred for herself) helped create the office of the First Lady. Her political partnership with her husband and the manner in which she expanded the First Lady&#x2019;s role prefigured the activist First Ladies of our own era.</p><h2>The Exercise Cure: A Doctor#s All-Natural, No-Pill Prescription for Better Health and Longer Life</h2><p>What if there were a drug to treat every illness, across all body systems, proven potent against heart disease, depression, arthritis, PMS and erectile dysfunction &#x2014; even in chronic diseases such as asthma, dementia, and certain types of cancer?

By increasing the use of the world's most effective preventive medicine: <i>exercise</i>. <br>Jordan D. Metzl, MD, explains how everyone can maximize their daily dose in his groundbreaking new book, THE EXERCISE CURE. In THE EXERCISE CURE, Dr. Metzl &#x2014; nationally renowned sports medicine physician &#x2014; offers malady-specific and well-researched exercise prescriptions to help readers stay healthy, heal disease, drop pounds, increase longevity, and transform their lives. <br>Today's medical system is largely focused on fixing rather than preventing problems, and many treatments carry significant side effects. Cholesterol-lowering drugs are linked to frequent muscle and joint problems, anti-hypertensive drugs like Beta-blockers cause headaches and diminished energy, and Prozac and other popular anti-depressant medications carry multiple consequences including sexual dysfunction. Dr. Metzl knows that exercise is inexpensive, powerful medicine that has benefits in prevention and treatment of disease without disturbing side effects. Even in older adults, daily exercise has been found to prevent dementia by generating neuron development in the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain. <br>Combining the latest data and his proven motivational skills, Dr. Metzl addresses the common maladies troubling millions. He discusses our cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, musculoskeletal, neurologic, reproductive, and endocrinologic body systems, with special sections on sleep problems and cancer prevention, presenting the science behind the role of exercise as medicine. Then, he details fun, fat-torching, life-prolonging workouts that can be tailored easily to any fitness level, beginner to advanced, and provides nutritional information, including meal plans for healthy eating and disease prevention, as well.</p><p>JORDAN METZL, MD, is the author of <i>The Athlete's Book of Home Remedies </i>and a nationally known sports medicine physician at New York City's Hospital for Special Surgery.

He lives in New York City.CHAPTER 1<br><br>Brain and Psychological Problems<br><br>Neurologists used to believe that movement affected only the primitive areas of the brain, and that the more evolved areas--such the prefrontal cortex--were reserved for "higher" functioning: social interaction, planning, and emotional intelligence.<br><br>Turns out that the areas of the brain affected by movement are interlaced throughout the whole organ. Said one neurologist I know, "There's hardly a cell in your brain that isn't profoundly affected by movement." That means that you can directly affect your emotional centers by taking a run. You can literally light up your brain's decision-making circuitry with a trip to the weight room.<br><br>More and more, it's clear that exercise is a remarkably potent "way in" that helps us avoid, improve, and sometimes even solve psychological problems--from stress to sleep problems, from fatigue to addiction. Exercise and movement of all kinds grow and organize the brain in a very powerful and direct way that we're only starting to understand. So get moving--and start feeling better.<br><br>THE PROBLEM: Addiction<br><br>THE SYMPTOMS: You're drawn to some type of mood-altering behavior or substance, and you keep giving in to it, despite negative consequences. Symptoms include preoccupation with your drug or behavior of choice, a lack of control over it, and continued use despite adverse consequences. Another big sign: denial that a problem exists. If it feels good now, feels awful later, and you can't stop yourself from doing it, chances are it's an addiction.<br><br>WHAT'S GOING ON: Addictions come in many forms, some of which can cause physiological dependency, others of which are, more accurately, intense forms of compulsive behavior.<br><br>In the case of physiological dependency, the body begins to rely on the substance to function properly and needs more and more of it to achieve the original, euphoric feeling (this is called tolerance). When the substance is removed, withdrawal symptoms occur, and the person needs to go through a period of detoxification in order to relearn how to function without it. Common withdrawal symptoms include acute cravings for your drug of choice, headaches, cold sweats, anxiety, tremors, irritability, nausea, and hallucinations. Smoking, drugs, alcohol, and some medications can lead to this type of dependency.<br><br>Other behaviors, including gambling, playing video games, watching and obsessing over sports, and using pornography can be addictive to varying degrees, as can some types of behavior that are usually considered beneficial--including calorie-restricted dieting, sex, and even exercise. And a newer addiction: social media. Some people really do need their "Facebook fix."<br><br>Depending on the person and the substance, an addiction can take hold overnight or over many years.<br><br>Why do addictions happen? People typically have a genetic predisposition to addictive behavior--if your parents are addictive types, you are more likely to be as well. But addiction has an environmental component, too, as you can't become addicted to something you've never experienced (which is why the first one's always free).<br><br>At some point, the addictive substance or behavior gets hard-wired to a biochemical process in the brain, which creates an illusion of euphoria, relaxation, and happiness when you experience your drug or behavior of choice, and an increasing desire for and preoccupation with the drug. The behaviors around obtaining the drug, and hiding your use of it, may further add to the allure of the addictive substance.<br><br>YOUR EXERCISE<br><br>Rx<br><br>Exercise can help combat virtually any addiction (except exercise addiction, naturally). Says one 2011 study published in Current Neuropharmacology, "Exercise leads to an increase in the synthesis and release of dopamine, stimulates neuroplasticity and promotes feelings of wellbeing. Moreover, exercise and drugs of abuse activate overlapping neural systems." Researchers have theorized that this might explain why regular exercise helps to prevent addiction from taking hold--and can play a role in curing it as well.<br><br>In many studies, exercise has been shown to have a pacifying effect on addictive behavior. It blunts the urge to take drugs, gamble, and smoke, for example. A review of studies published in 2012 looked at the effect of exercise in people who were trying to quit smoking. Several of the studies reviewed showed "significantly" higher abstinence rates for the groups that exercised versus those that didn't. In this study, two groups of rats were exposed to amphetamines: one group of normal rats, another group that had a fully ingrained exercise habit. The exercising rats showed no preference for amphetamines, whereas the nonexercisers couldn't get enough of them.<br><br>Overall, this may explain why, statistically, exercisers are much less likely than inactive people to become addicts.<br><br>When to Call a Doctor<br><br>This can be problematic. Most addicts will never call a doctor or even ask for help with their problem. They believe they can handle it. Or they don't want to face it. Even with family interventions, an addict won't pursue real change until he or she is ready. And "ready" can be a long way off and include some horrifying consequences for the addict and those close to him or her. If you know an addict, seek professional guidance for them (and for yourself on how to handle the problem), and try to help as best you can. If you're an addict, deep down you probably know it. Even if you can't imagine a life without your addiction of choice, that better life is out there. There is no shame in admitting you need help--and the professional help out there is very real and very effective if you commit to it.<br><br>Another study, however, conducted by the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign in 2012, offers a different and perhaps somewhat qualified perspective of the value of exercise in overcoming addiction.<br><br>Two groups of mice--one habituated to exercise, the other not--were exposed, and became addicted to, liquid cocaine. The formerly sedentary mice were then also habituated to exercise. When the cocaine was taken away from both groups, the mice that had only taken up exercise after exposure to cocaine were able to break their addiction much more easily than those who had the exercise habit in place before exposure. In some cases, the poor previously exercise-addicted mice continued to crave cocaine for the rest of their lives.<br><br>So does this mean that we shouldn't begin an exercise program unless and until we have an addiction to overcome? Or that exercising regularly will make you more susceptible to addiction?<br><br>It's hard to say: Mice aren't people, after all, and it was just one experiment. The big-picture lesson, say the researchers, may be that exercise primes the brain to learn, and adopt, new behaviors--regardless of whether those behaviors are self-destructive or beneficial. (This seems to be true at any age, by the way).<br><br>WHEN EXERCISE IS THE ADDICTION<br><br>Yes, it's possible. You can be addicted to exercise (the very definition of "too much of a good thing"). It stands to reason: Exercise can induce physiological pleasure responses the same way a drug can. Motor activity stimulates the release of dopamine, a naturally occurring narcotic in the brain that is also stimulated by many addictive substances and behaviors, including cocaine and methamphetamine. Natural endorphins, enkephalins, and endocannabinoids (opium- and marijuana-like substances also manufactured in the brain) also get in on the act.<br><br>There are signals for exercise addiction in both mind and body. In the mind: Does it dominate your life? Will you be seriously derailed for the day if you don't exercise? In the body: chronic overuse injuries. All these are signs that you're exercising in unhealthy ways and should talk to your doctor about it.<br><br>In my own case, I'm probably a borderline exercise addict. I need it every day and I recommend it every day for my patients. I watch myself carefully. I'll ask myself, "If I'm going to give up a workout, why? Am I going to miss a dinner I should go to, or an important meeting, or a special occasion?" I'm pretty good about this, but not perfect. And that's the overall point of this entire section: Recognizing your own addictive tendencies--stepping back and seeing your own behavior--is a huge part of recognizing a potential problem.<br><br>For you and me, that may mean that if you're trying to adopt or break a habit--be it eating less sugar, smoking fewer cigarettes, or shaking an Internet jones--you might want to begin or make a change in your exercise program at the same time: Start jogging or cycling or switch from rock climbing to martial arts, for example. The fresh neurons that your new or unfamiliar exercise program stimulates may make it easier to adopt the new behavior you're trying to master.<br><br>To recap:<br><br>. Exercise helps prevent addiction from taking hold.<br><br>. Exercise can help overcome addictive behaviors once they have taken hold.<br><br>. If struggling to overcome an addiction (or adopt a new behavior in general), you may benefit from making a change in your exercise program at the same time.<br><br>THE PROBLEM: Anxiety<br><br>THE SYMPTOMS: You're worried, concerned, and fearful, generally about some threatening event in the future over which you feel you have little control. You may feel nauseated, shaky, experience blurred or tunnel vision, a racing heart, fatigue, the frequent need to go to the bathroom, panic attacks, and difficulty concentrating.<br><br>WHAT'S GOING ON: Anxiety can arise as a normal response to an upcoming frightening or stressful situation. In some circumstances, the response may actually provide a helpful cue that prompts you to confront a nagging or difficult problem, or helps you avoid a dangerous situation. Studies have shown that people with anxiety are, in fact, less likely to die in accidents.<br><br>Performance anxiety, stage fright, or fear preceding a test or evaluation are all common forms of anxiety. A certain amount of arousal is necessary for high performance, of course--too much, however, can hinder performance.<br><br>But, like depression and other mood disturbances, anxiety can also come up for no clear reason, attached to no obvious external threat or event, and ultimately become debilitating. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, and social anxiety are all clinical forms of anxiety and should be treated with help from a health care provider.<br><br>YOUR EXERCISE<br><br>Rx<br><br>Exercise can be a powerful tool in preventing anxiety in the first place: People who exercise consistently are 25 percent less likely to develop anxiety than those who don't. In cases of mild anxiety, exercise can be extremely helpful, easing symptoms in just a few minutes, and though it can't cure chronic anxiety, it can help diminish its symptoms.<br><br>. TRY YOGA. Anxiety is often accompanied by a response from the sympathetic nervous system--the "fight or flight" response that prepares you for challenging physical activity. If you're chronically anxious, this system is probably working overtime, keeping your mind racing and your body keyed up, even when you're trying as hard as you can to calm down.<br><br>A 2011 review of research published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found promising evidence that yoga may help relieve the symptoms of some types of mild anxiety--probably because the slow, languid movements and focus on deep breaths help stimulate a parasympathetic, calming response from the autonomic nervous system. Two or three classes a week of yoga can be very beneficial in this regard. And once you get the hang of it, you can try a little yoga breathing or a few asanas (yoga poses) whenever you feel symptoms of anxiety start to come up.<br><br>. GO FOR THE GOLD. Another study, published in 2005 in Behavior Research and Therapy, found that regular aerobic exercise also reduced anxiety and "anxiety sensitivity," or the fear of the sensation of anxiety itself, and that a higher intensity of this type of exercise worked better than a lower intensity. So if you're anxious, hit up the gold standard of exercise as described in Part 3--and skew your aerobic workouts a little tougher.<br><br>When to Call a Doctor<br><br>Intense and ongoing anxiety can take a toll on your life, cutting into productivity and leisure time. If anxiety is starting to become chronic and unmanageable, see a doctor. If left untreated, anxiety can become a debilitating disorder. Exercise is terrific treatment for a mild anxiety disorder, but the more serious variants need the help of a trained mental health professional.<br><br>THE PROBLEM: Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)<br><br>THE SYMPTOMS: In children, an inability to concentrate, as well as difficulty following directions, sticking to tasks, and accomplishing household chores and schoolwork. Children with ADHD are easily bored and distracted, and often have difficulty sitting still and controlling their impulses.<br><br>In adults, ADHD often manifests in difficulty with time management, organization, goal setting, and emotional control--all of which can interfere with employment and relationships. Depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse, and addiction disproportionately affect adults with ADHD.<br><br>WHAT'S GOING ON: ADHD can be a very frustrating condition, both for the children and adults it affects and for those around them. Its exact causes are unknown, though heredity, chemical imbalances, and traumatic head injury may contribute to the condition. Women who eat poorly, smoke, or abuse drugs or alcohol during pregnancy are also more likely to give birth to children with ADHD.<br><br>ADHD is a behavioral condition and has no physical symptoms--though a doctor may take x-rays or a blood test to rule out any underlying physical conditions. Other psychological conditions, such as anxiety and depression, can cause similar symptoms, so doctors or specialists will take a thorough medical and personal history to verify the diagnosis.<br><br>ADHD does not come on in adulthood but is a lifelong condition. If, as an adult, you suspect you may have ADHD, a specialist will focus questions on your behavior, development, and relationships starting at childhood to determine the root cause of your condition.<br><br>Treatments for ADHD include prescription medications and various types of psychosocial interventions, including psychotherapy, behavioral modifications, special education, and social skills training. Left untreated, children with ADHD are at greater risk for teen pregnancy, car accidents, and drug and alcohol use. They are also more likely to have learning disabilities.<br><br>Since its causes aren't fully understood, ADHD can't be cured or prevented. But behavioral interventions, and drugs, if necessary, can go a long way in helping to regulate impulsive behavior and to help an affected child grow up to be productive and successful. Another helpful treatment: exercise.<br><br>YOUR EXERCISE<br><br>Rx<br><br>Recent research suggests that exercise can be very effective in improving ADHD symptoms, in part by raising levels of dopamine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), two neurotransmitters responsible for growth and learning. In one 2011 study, a 28-day program of daily treadmill running, 30 minutes a day, raised levels of dopamine and BDNF in hyperactive rats and improved their ability to find their way around a complex maze.<br><br>In humans, exercise can temporarily raise levels of dopamine (and the adrenal hormone norepinephrine)--thus mimicking the effects of ADHD drugs like Ritalin and Adderall. In the brain, exercise can stimulate the ...</p><h2>The Batman/Judge Dredd Collection</h2><p>When Batman crosses paths with the gleefully violent Judge Dredd, things are bound to get ugly!

She lives with her family in Alabama. To the best of her knowledge, Rachel is not a witch, though some of her former students may disagree.Fifteen-year-old Izzy Brannick comes from generations of monster hunters. Witches, vampires, faeries, werewolves-her forebears have dealt with them all, and mostly come out on top. But ever since Izzy's older sister disappeared a year ago while confronting a coven of witches, Izzy and her mother have become the last of the Brannicks. Keeping up the family business, the two of them move to a small Mississippi town to investigate a simple haunting. Naturally, nothing is quite that easy: the vengeful ghost is unusually powerful, the cute new boy in town has a mysterious aura of power around him, and homeschooled Izzy needs to learn how to make friends and survive her first high school experience. A charming and zippy paranormal mystery, Hawkins's self-contained spinoff from her Hex Hall series is built around a likeable bunch of characters including a heroine who is smart, kind, and resourceful, and a team of refreshingly non-stereotypical friends. Ace plotting, snappy dialogue, unexpected twists, and an exhilarating finale will have readers eager for more. Ages 12 18. Agent: Holly Root, Waxman Leavell Literary Agency. (May) PW"<br><br>Gr 7-10 Since her older sister went missing nearly a year ago, 15-year-old Izzy and her mother are all that remain of the family. Endowed with extra strength and supernatural powers, the Brannicks have been ridding the world of evil creatures for thousands of years. Without her sister by her side, it's a lonely life for Izzy, who is still trying to prove to her mother that she is ready to handle the family business on her own. After a nearly disastrous run-in with a vampire, her mother decides to give her something easier to work on. They move to Mississippi, and the teen enrolls in the local high school where a rogue ghost has attempted to kill one of the teachers. Dealing with the ghost should be a simple task, but attending high school for the first time is a scary prospect for the homeschooled teen. She joins the school-sanctioned Paranormal Management Society and becomes friends with its members. She begins to fall in love with one of them and discovers that another member may be the reason she can't get the ghost under control. Always warned by her mother to go in, do the job, and get out, Izzy realizes that the relationships she's formed may be placing people's lives in jeopardy. It's impossible not to compare this book to Buffy the Vampire Slayer as it blends equal parts humor, drama, and romance just like the popular TV series. Girls will eat this one up. Cary Frostick, Mary Riley Styles Public Library, Falls Church, VA SLJ"<br><br>In her Hex Hall spin-off, Hawkins takes us to Ideal, Mississippi, where fifteen-year-old Izzy Brannick and her mother have fled for a breather from Izzy's sister's disappearance and Izzy's own botched vampire slaying. But Ideal is hardly the ideal small town. Instead, the high school where Izzy will soon enroll has endured a series of progressively escalating hauntings. Perhaps this is Izzy's chance to restore her reputation by solving a tragic, yet harmless, ghost visitation gone awry. Or perhaps it's just the opportunity she hasn't even known she desired: to finally have a best friend and even a boyfriend, who, by the way, might just be a Prodigium, a warlock of sorts. In true Hawkins fashion, School Spirits combines romance, intrigue, and the paranormal with humor and \ high-school drama to produce a light read that bodes well for another Hawkins series, this time featuring the Brannicks. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: This spinoff of the New York Times Bestselling Hex Hall series should be similarly well-received. - Frances Bradburn Booklist"<br><br>Izzy-short for Isolde-and her mother are the last in their centuries-old line of monster killers. Izzy's sister Finley disappeared while the sisters were dealing with a witches' coven, and Izzy has felt guilty about the incident ever since, holding herself responsible. Looking for a break, Izzy's mom moves them to Ideal, Miss., and sends Izzy to high school, an environment completely foreign to the girl, with the hope that she will be able to deal with a local ghost. Izzy makes actual friends there but learns that this ghost has far more power than usual, and she comes to suspect that one of her cherished new friends may have summoned it. Worse, she's attracted to Dex, but the boy gives off vibes that Izzy picks up as supernatural. She can't tell just what kind of being Dex might be, but she hopes she won't have to kill him. Hawkins dials the level of humor up to high throughout most of the book, with deftly phrased witticisms in both the narrative ("worry slithered through me") and her characters' dialogue ("I am affronted!" declares Dex). Her characterizations shine as original and funny, especially Dex and Torin, an Elizabethan-era warlock trapped for centuries in the Brannicks' mirror, who dispenses dubious advice. Finley still being missing, it's entirely possible this, itself a spinoff of the Hex Hall books, may become a series. Here's hoping the Brannicks will be back-their story's marvelous fun.

Trained by her mother, Izzie has become a fearless warrior against these renegades who have broken the rules of the Council. Now Izzie must go undercover as a regular high school student to track down a powerful ghost that is haunting the town. As she settles into her new job, Izzie finds that she really enjoys making new friends and just being a regular teen. There is also her growing romantic interest in Dex to make things even more confusing. But the job must come first and Izzie is determined to succeed. This is an exciting paranormal romance that provides a dynamic and riveting plot line that will keep readers eagerly turning pages. Hawkins also takes care to develop her main character fully, allowing us to feel Izzie's struggle between her desire to just be a normal teen and her need to fulfill a destiny she has not chosen. The romantic tension between Izzie and Dex is nicely done, with a minimum of gooey purple prose. The ending ties up a bit too neatly, but fans of paranormal romances and Hawkins' Hex Hall series will be thrilled with this new series.-Jan Chapman. VOYA"<br><br>This zippy fun read begins a new magical series about the tough Brannick women, a spin-off of Hawkins' popular Hex Hall series. Featuring Isolde, they go around fighting monsters. Izzy and her mother move to a new town to deal with a haunting at a local high school. Izzy is going to prove herself worthy by blending in with the local students and finding this ghost herself. She makes friends, develops a crush on Dex, and deals with Torin, the warlock who has been trapped in the family mirror for centuries. This is a good story filled with magic, excitement, a little romance and danger, and teen issues. The author adds humor to the dialogue, and most situations are realistic and believable. It reads quickly and easily and offers older reluctant readers some fun. Readers will definitely be awaiting the next Brannick adventure. Melinda W.

A range of characters, male and female, tell about a particular group of Japanese who emigrated to Brazil in the first decades of this century. Christian, well-educated, and reasonably affluent, they sought to establish communities where Christian and Japanese values could flourish. The group prospered, though not without cost, and it is this cost that's a major theme here. A secondary theme, suggested by the quotes from the philosopher Rousseau that precede each section, is the nature of education in a new world where emigrants' children often have only ``natural and purely physical knowledge.'' Young Emile begins with his recollections of his 1925 arrival in Brazil as a small child; the uncomfortable journey to the settlement where families already there helped them clear land; and the hard work required to become self-sufficient. But even the most idealistic communities have problems, and, successively, Emile, Haru, Kantaro, and Genji, over the years, record the events and personalities that threatened the group: Kantaro, the visionary and dilettante, whose enterprises from baseball to chicken-farming had unforeseen consequences; the bitter divisions caused by WW I that led to the murder of an original founder; the effects of the enduring passion of Yergo for Haru; and the increased assimilation with neighboring Brazilians. Paradoxically, assimilated Guillerme notes in an epilogue that thousands of unemployed Japanese-Brazilians are currently working in Japan as menial labor. Though often seeming more a work of reportage than a novel, Yamashita's characters are vital, full-bodied creations offering sufficient balance, as well as answers to the questions raised.

His opinions on social and foreign policy, law, education and race, among other topics, reflect a generally conservative, realistic approach to problems that, he notes, result more often in political tradeoffs than so-called solutions advocated by "deep thinkers." His most acerbic comments concern special-interest groups such as homosexual lobbies, bigoted crusaders of all kinds, the welfare system, pay equity and sex education. He supports Reagan's strong anti-Communism, defense and South African policies, along with the president's selection of judges and opposition to judicial activism. Sowell also favors legalization of drugs and equal opportunity over affirmative action. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.This anthology of recent pieces by Sowell, a brilliant economist currently at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, is drawn from his Scripps-Howard syndicated column and his contributions to the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post. While Sowell, who is black, is known as an expert in the economics and politics of race, he is also a thinker of wide-ranging interestsas attested by these provocative writings organized under headings such as "Education," "The Law," and "Foreign Policy." What ties the essays together is his ability to look at the cost and benefits of various concepts, proposals, and actions (comparable worth, judicial activism, etc.) and analyze the trade-offs with common sense.

Next, he suggests the rise of a white urban business class in the South after World War II effectively challenged planter domination and ultimately provided the social space for the emergence of black protest.

He serves the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, where he lives with his wife, Denalyn, and their mischievous mutt, Andy.</p>Lucado, pastor and bestselling author of more than 50 titles, extends hope to those whose souls are "dehydrated" from neglect, fear and guilt. Lucado teaches that salvation is God's work, not ours, and that we should "[d]rink deeply from his well of grace." He encourages readers to look to God for spiritual energy, to rest in his authority or "lordship" and to wholeheartedly accept his never-ending love. Lucado's signature style&#x2014;simple, easygoing, occasionally poetic&#x2014;includes lots of stories that make some of the difficult truths he covers go down easy. He leaves some questions unanswered (like exactly how spiritual energy works), but also handles weighty issues (how can God be good and omnipotent, but still allow bad things to happen?) without being insincere or cavalier. While the book focuses on the grace and life God can provide, Lucado also challenges readers to live up to their faith&#x2014;to pray, obey and surrender everything to God. Lucado indicates that his own heart has been dehydrated at times: "Don't you need regular sips from God's reservoir? I do.... Drink with me from his bottomless well." His writing seems to come not from the pulpit high above but from the guy next door who understands what it's like to be where readers are. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The second half he spent in the creation of the mighty roman-fleuve that is <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, memorializing his own dandyism and parvenu hijinks even as he revealed their essential hollowness. Proust begins, of course, at the beginning--with the earliest childhood perceptions and sorrows. Then, over several thousand pages, he retraces the course of his own adolescence and adulthood, democratically dividing his experiences among the narrator and a sprawling cast of characters. Who else has ever decanted life into such ornate, knowing, wrought-iron sentences? Who has subjected love to such merciless microscopy, discriminating between the tiniest variations of desire and self-delusion? Who else has produced a grief-stricken record of time's erosion that can also make you laugh for entire pages?

With <em>Desperate Sons</em>, the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Bringing Adam Home</em> tells the remarkable story of America&#x2019;s first patriots, the Sons of Liberty, whose revolutionary acts have become legend. With all the suspense and power of a historical action thriller, Standiford&#x2019;s <em>Desperate Sons</em> recounts the courage and tenacity of a hardy group that included Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, and John Hancock&#x2014;radical activists who were responsible for some of the most notorious events leading up to the American Revolution, from the Boston Tea Party to Paul Revere&#x2019;s fabled midnight ride.

Angry and frustrated that King George III and the British Parliament had ignored their lawful complaints and petitions, they decided to take action.</p><p>Knowing that their deeds&#x2014;often directed at individuals and property&#x2014;were illegal, and punishable by imprisonment and even death, these agitators plotted and conducted their missions in secret to protect their identities as well as the identities of those who supported them. Calling themselves the Sons of Liberty, they gathered together in a radical society committed to imposing forcible change. Those determined men&#x2014;including second cousins Samuel and John Adams, Paul Revere, Patrick Henry, and John Hancock&#x2014;saw themselves as patriots. Yet to the Crown, and to many of the Sons' fellow colonists, the revolutionaries were terrorists who deserved death for their treason.</p><p>In this gripping narrative, Les Standiford reveals how this group of intelligent, committed men, motivated by economics and political belief, began a careful campaign of interlocking events that would channel feelings of vague injustice into an armed rebellion of common cause, which would defeat an empire and give birth to a radical political experiment&#x2014;a new nation known as the United States.</p><p>Les Standiford is the bestselling author of twenty books and novels, including the John Deal mystery series, and the works of narrative history <em>The Man Who Invented Christmas</em> (a <em>New York Times</em> Editors&#x2019; Choice) and <em>Last Train to Paradise</em>.

With his niece, his sidekick Angie, and his friend Chas, Constantine makes a last-ditch sacrifice to distract the unnamed beast from his global tide of mutilation in order to save humankind. The volume begins with a short tale showing how Gemma is increasingly following in her uncle's crafty, manipulative footsteps. The artwork is scratchy and moody to good effect, and particularly good at capturing the canny surety of the antiheroic protagonist. The elements of mythology, apocrypha, and high-stakes drama are all in place, and the story is a worthy successor to the long line of mystic apocalypses that the character has faced in the past. However, to portray such infernal matters successfully, the series depicts matters of faith and violence with a particularly cynical hand. Despite excellent craftsmanship, such content and tone will prevent this series from being universally appealing.<i>&#x2013;Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When the book appeared in 1970, he had already published the three books of his <b>Salterton Trilogy</b>, which won him recognition in his native Canada as an incisive cultural critic and an endlessly entertaining novelist. He had struck a note near Mark Twain in his portrayal of small-town culture, satirizing the residents' pious absurdities without seeming cruel, dramatizing their dreams and good intentions without becoming sentimental. </p><p> With <b>Fifth Business</b>, he plumbed new artistic and spiritual depths. The opening scene, which he envisioned taking place at his boyhood home in Thamesville, Ontario, haunted Davies from the first time it appeared to him in about 1960 until he began to draft the novel ten years later: "It was simply a scene that kept occurring in my mind, which was of two boys on a village street on a winter night--I knew from the look of the atmosphere that it must be just around Christmas-time--and one boy threw a snowball at the other boy. Well, that was all there was to it, but it came so often and was so insistent that I had to ask myself, Why is that boy doing that and what is behind this and what is going on?" </p><p> Many elements of the novel that emerged from this vision were drawn from Davies's early childhood. Like Dunstable Ramsay's father, Davies's father was the one-man publisher of a village newspaper, and Davies grew up in the newspaper business. "In a newspaper family," he said, "you learn not only all the news that's fit to print, but all the news that is not fit to print, and you acquire an insight into human nature and the essence of a community which is very hard to acquire . . . in any other way." </p><p> Like his protagonist in <b>Fifth Business</b>, Davies was raised in the Presbyterian Church. Although he eventually rejected its particular doctrines, he retained a strongly religious temperament. His spiritual explorations ultimately found resonance in the works of Carl Gustav Jung. "Orthodox Christianity has always had for me the difficulty that it really won't come . . . to grips with the problem of evil," Davies said. "What looks good can be pushed to the point that it becomes evil, and . . . evil very frequently bears what can only be regarded as good fruit." Jung had portrayed God as a psychological reality that embraced polarities of good and evil, light and shadow; the devil is an inextricable part of him. One had to confront this shadow face-to-face in order to live a moral life. "The devil is the unexamined side of life," Davies said, "and the great evils spring from acting without knowledge of your subconscious intentions." </p><p> Davies was also drawn to Jung's deities because they had womanly as well as manly faces, faces that are reflected in his portrayal of Mary Dempster. Here were the feminine elements he found woefully lacking in Christianity, with its focus on God the Father and the Son. In Jung's landscape of the psyche, Davies found a theoretical grounding for the diverse representations of human quest and conflict he had come to appreciate. Beyond the Judeo-Christian literary tradition was a rich world of folk tales, myths, ghost stories, and legends that were sacred in their own way, striking deep spiritual chords in our unconscious. From this same sensibility sprang Davies's lifelong interest in saints, which he, like Ramsay, appreciated not as narrowly defined religious figures, but as archetypes of universal characters and tales. </p><p> The remarkable events that unfold in this "enchanted landscape" owe much to Davies's lifelong love of the theater. From boyhood he was drawn to the traveling circus, the magic show, and the movie palace. Over the course of his career he worked for the Old Vic Repertory Company in London, wrote a dozen plays, and was one of the founders of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. His passion for theater was so intense that his novels have sometimes been criticized for their theatricality: How does Ramsay just happen to meet Paul Dempster repeatedly in his travels, and how does Surgeoner "randomly" pick Ramsay from the crowd at Colborne College? But such theatrical events--call them coincidence or fate--lie at the heart of Davies's worldview. "I'm not in any way a devotee of realism," said Davies, "and the theatre is never realistic, even when it's pretending to be intensely so." The meaningful stories in our lives are dramatic rather than naturalistic, remarkable rather than random. </p><p> This appreciation of the theater of the inner life could come only with age. Davies was in his fifties when he explored these demons of youth in <b>Fifth Business</b>, and the result is a captivating narrative stance. While working on the manuscript, he wrote, "It is autobiographical, but not as young men would do it; it will be rather as Dickens wrote <b>David Copperfield</b>--a fictional reworking of some things experienced and much rearranged--a spiritual autobiography in fact, and not a sweating account of the first time I backed a girl into a corner." Davies's protagonist frequently distances himself from immediate events, adding the tincture of age and humor to vividly recalled experience. </p><p>The unforgettable tone that arises from this perspective has been characterized as a hybrid of satire and romance. Davies somehow manages to marry these seemingly incompatible viewpoints, delighting in his own former naivet� and the follies of his youth while maintaining a fundamental earnestness about Ramsay's aspirations. It is the voice of a man at mid-life who has taken unusual paths, who is fascinated by the possibilities that lie before him, and who has lost neither his youthful seriousness nor his sense of humor. </p><p> Despite his established reputation in Canada, Davies was little known to U.S. readers and reviewers when <b>Fifth Business</b> was published in 1970. The American reception was exuberant, propelling the novel to bestseller lists in both the U.S. and Canada. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt described it in the <b>New York Times</b> as "a marvelously enigmatic novel . . . elegantly written and driven by irresistible narrative. One thinks of <b>The Magic Mountain</b> and <b>The French Lieutenant's Woman</b>, although Mr. Davies hardly needs Thomas Mann and John Fowles to prop him up." </p><p> Other reviewers praised the remarkable range of erudition he conveys in his works. Saints and card tricks, brandy and psychology, linguistics and bearded ladies are all objects of his insatiable curiosity. Davies is modest about the range of his learning, pointing out that some academics thought Shakespeare must have been a sailor because of the convincing seaman's slang in <b>The Tempest</b>: "It's all hooey. Shakespeare had a few telling details which he injected into his plays that made them seem realistic, and I have the same in my novels." A veteran once asked Davies where he had served in France during the Great War, for only a soldier could have captured the mud and panic of the trenches so vividly. Davies had to reply that he was in the cradle at the time. Similarly, his fictional prescription for bringing an ailing cello back to its true voice with a poultice of horse manure was pure fancy. Even the definition of "<b>Fifth Business</b>" that opens the book&#x2014;cited from a dull, untranslated account of Danish theater and first taken as yet another example of Davies's eccentric knowledge&#x2014;was revealed to be entirely fictional when the Norwegian edition of the book was published (although the notion it conveys of "<b>Fifth Business</b>" in the theater is quite accurate). </p><p> The key is to be convincing, true to the spirit rather than to mere facts. As Davies described the art of writing: </p><p> If you're a writer . . . you're a descendent of those medieval storytellers who used to go into the square of a town and spread a little mat on the ground and sit on it and beat on a bowl and say, 'If you give me a copper coin I will tell you a golden tale.' If the storyteller had what it took, he . . . told them a golden tale until it got to the most exciting point and then he passed the bowl again. </p><p> His storytelling prowess earned him frequent comparisons to Charles Dickens--a comparison of which he was not overly fond. The authors he admired included Victor Hugo, Honore de Balzac, Anthony Trollope, Evelyn Waugh, and Daniel Defoe, all very different writers, but all possessing what he called shamanstvo--the enchanter quality, from the word shaman. Like Dickens, Davies had a flair for the dramatic and could sketch a secondary character unforgettably in just a few lines (the portraits of Rev. Leadbeater, Orph Wettenhall, and Boy's stepdaughter Lorene in <b>Fifth Business</b>, for example). But he was more daring in his experiments with form than he is often given credit for, and his novelistic objectives are decidedly modern rather than Victorian. </p><p> As Michiko Kakutani wrote in the <b>New York Times</b>, Davies "has created a rich oeuvre of densely plotted, highly symbolic novels that not only function as superbly funny entertainments but also give the reader, in his character's words, a deeper kind of pleasure&#x2014; delight, awe, religious intimations, a fine sense of the past, and of the boundless depth and variety of life." </p><p> <b>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS</b><br><br> 1. When Percy Boyd Staunton denies his share of responsibility for the snowball that hit Mrs. Dempster and caused her premature labor, Dunstable Ramsay feels the full weight of guilt on his shoulders. Even years later, when he seeks out Mrs. Dempster again, he is highly sensitive to the magistrate's charge: <b>"Guilt . . . somebody bears it to this day!"</b> Why does he feel this guilt so keenly? To what extent is he responsible for Paul's fate? For Staunton's?<br><br> 2. Many of the characters in <b>Fifth Business</b> change their names. Dunstable Ramsay becomes Dunstan, Percy Boyd Staunton becomes Boy Staunton, Paul Dempster becomes Faustus Legrand and later Magnus Eisengrim. What happens when each of them is "born again"? Which aspects of their characters endure, and which are transformed? <br><br> 3. Young Dunstable's flight from his mother colors the rest of his life. When he contemplates his relationship with Diana, his first lover, he shuns the motherly quality of her affection: <b>"I had no intention of being anyone's dear laddie, ever again."</b> How and why do the other men in the novel (Boy Staunton, Paul Dempster) flee their mothers? What are they seeking in a woman? How are the ideal and the reality of motherhood and womanhood conveyed in Ramsay's reflections on the virgin Mary? <br><br> 4. "People marry most happily with their own kind," Davies once wrote. "The trouble lies in the fact that people usually marry at an age where they do not really know what their own kind is." What would have happened if Dunstan had married Leola? What kind of marriage would have better suited Boy?<br><br> </p><p>5. <b>"If you think her a saint, she is a saint to you,"</b> says Padre Blazon of Ramsay's fascination with Mary Dempster. What place does she come to occupy in his psychological landscape? Why is he so possessive of her, refusing to ask for Boy's assistance for her care? <br><br> 6. King Edward VIII of England was forced to abdicate in 1936 after less than a year in office because he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American who was felt to be an unacceptable Queen. Why was this such a bitter blow to Boy? What did Edward represent to him? 7. If Ramsay is truly "<b>Fifth Business</b>," as Liesl describes, who are the hero and heroine, sorceress, and villain of the story? Do they correspond to the "<b>usual cabal</b>" described at the book's conclusion? Who are "<b>the Basso and the Brazen Head</b>" Liesl refers to in her letter? Who was the woman Boy knew and the woman he didn't know? <br><br> 8. Ganymede was a beautiful Trojan prince who was seized and carried to Olympus by Zeus's eagle to become the cup-bearer of the gods. Ramsay suggests that Boy's corporate proteges were expected to fill that role. What did he want from them, and why did they always disappoint him? <br><br> 9. "I seem to have emerged as a moralist; my novels are a moralist's novels," Davies said of his work. Certainly they are not moralistic in a conventional religious sense. In what sense are they moralistic? Ramsay tells Boy, <b>"You created a God in your own image, and when you found out he was no good you abolished him. It's a quite common form of psychological suicide."</b> What kind of God has Ramsay set up for himself? What light is shed on his moral character by his discussions of the devil? His talk with Surgeoner about fictional testimonials? <br><br> 10. <b>Fifth Business</b> has sometimes been read as an allegory of Canada's struggle for recognition and identity. Who do you think plays the part of the U. S. in this interpretation? What devils might Canada have to address to develop fully as a nation?</p><b>Robertson Davies</b> (1913&#x2013;1995) was born and raised in Ontario, and was educated at a variety of schools, including Upper Canada College, Queen&#x2019;s University, and Balliol College, Oxford. He had three successive careers: as an actor with the Old Vic Company in England; as publisher of the Peterborough Examiner; and as university professor and first Master of Massey College at the University of Toronto, from which he retired in 1981 with the title of Master Emeritus. <br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>He was one of Canada&#x2019;s most distinguished men of letters, with several volumes of plays and collections of essays, speeches, and belles lettres to his credit.

This dazzling account of how to live with one foot on earth and one in heaven, and with the double vision that is the gift of faith, is rooted in the notion that the promises we make at baptism, like ordination vows, call us all to make known the good news of God&#x2019;s love in Christ and to celebrate God&#x2019;s presence in the world. <br><br>It reflects on the indifferent, preoccupied world in which the church finds itself today; the ways that God calls us; how we discern vocation; the language we use about faith; what worship is; how we read the Bible - and how it reads us; the power of the sacraments, and the art of preaching.</p><p>Barbara Brown Taylor is a priest in the Episcopal Church and author of a number of critically acclaimed books.

Working from her studio in New York, she produces extraordinarily atmospheric near-abstract representations of the effects of light and shade on land, sea and sky. Her works, which draw on influences as varied as French Impressionism, Dutch landscape painting and Abstract Expressionism, have been exhibited in North America, Europe and Japan. This account of Wilson&#39;s life - from her immersion in the vibrant New York art world of the 1950s and 1960s to her current approach to painting - is given new insight through previously unpublished photographs of the artist and her family and friends, and is lavishly illustrated with beautiful reproductions of her artworks.</p><p>Elisabeth Sussman is Curator and Sondra Gilman Curator of Photography at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.Wilson&#39;s recent paintings are luminous landscapes that hover between abstraction and representation - ARIZONA REPUBLIC REVIEW</p><h2>The History of London in Maps</h2><p>Historic maps since the 1550s are accompanied by contemporary views</p><p></p><h2>Bhagvad Gita As It Is English New Edition</h2><p>Bhagavad Gita is universally renowned as the jewel of India&#39;s Spiritual wisdom.

At the age of nineteen, although he had never even held a gun, he joined the Marines and would spend the next twenty years behind the scope of a long-range precision rifle as a sniper.<br>In that time he accumulated one of the most successful sniper records in the Corps, ranging through many of the world's hotspots. During Operation Iraqi Freedom alone, he recorded at least thirty-six kills, thirteen of them in a single twenty-four-hour period.<br>Now Coughlin has written a highly personal story about his deadly craft, taking readers deep inside an invisible society that is off-limits to outsiders.

Jack Coughlin carried his specially designed bolt action rifle--and its nearly magical scope--into a landscape of sandstorms, firefights, and chaos during Operation Iraqi Freedom. As marines charged through the desert and leapfrogged through bizarre, treacherous urban battlefields, Coughlin and his sniper teammate did their job and did it well: One by one, they spotted their targets--up to a half a mile away.

Teacher&#39;s Guide available. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Gr 5-9-This overview includes nearly 200 pages of well-organized, attractively presented information. The opening chapters offer a chronology of the age of dinosaurs, a brief history of key discoveries, and lots of information about the creatures' habits and characteristics in general. The heart of the book is the 50 or so profiles of individual dinosaur genera, divided into the two major groups (bird-hipped and lizard-hipped). Each one includes size, location, and era, as well as basic information and intriguing facts. While not a comprehensive dictionary of species, the entries offer a wealth of information. The attractive layout makes this a good resource for both browsing and for more in-depth research. The uncluttered "profiles" feature one main illustration of the dinosaur, along with a few smaller captioned illustrations. A time line, fact file, and map for each species appears consistently on the edge of the page. Interspersed among the introductory chapters and profiles are over a dozen dramatic, full-page and two-page scenes, vividly capturing selected species in action. Several recent discoveries are mentioned, and current theories are clearly distinguished from accepted fact in such areas as classification, evolutionary factors, and behaviors. Though not quite as visually exciting as David Lambert's DK Guide to Dinosaurs (DK, 2000) or as comprehensive as Douglas Dixon's The Simon &amp; Schuster Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Creatures (S &amp; S, 2001), this title fills a need for reference materials for older students.<p></p><p><i>Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Gr. 6-10. In this lushly illustrated, comprehensive text, Barrett provides an overview of just about anything young readers might need on the subject of dinosaurs. He defines the species; moves step-by-step through the stages of their existence; describes how archeologists dig, dress, and prepare their finds for exhibit; and relates how dinosaurs lived and moved. And that's just in the first 60 pages. The remainder of the book takes a closer look at individual species, introducing something unusual about each. Illustrations, maps, and fact boxes will make comparisons easy. A colorful sidebar thermostat highlights the span of time the species lived. Back matter considers theories about dinosaur extinction and takes a look at how dinosaurs have been portrayed in motion pictures.

For some people public speaking triggers a primal fear, arousing the fight-or-flight response, but each time I face an audience I look forward to another chance to be heard. During my almost ten years in Florida&#x2019;s foster care system I had no voice, even when I had something important&#x2014;possibly lifesaving&#x2014;to say. Even more, I was branded a liar because nobody wanted to hear the truth. Since everything I did as a kid became a part of my case file, attempts to discredit my word were written up as official documents and could have ruined any chances I had to be adopted or to lead a normal life.<br> <br>The people who come to hear me speak often have special connections to the foster care system. Among them are parents, judges, legislators, social workers, child welfare executives, and teachers. Sometimes my audience is made up of children or teens who have experienced loss or trauma like I did, or maybe they are young people from more traditional backgrounds and my story shows them what it might be like to grow up without a stable family. Maybe there are people who realize for the first time that children like me are in their midst.<br> <br>Even if my audiences have read my first memoir, Three Little Words, they want to hear me repeat some of the stories and ask me questions. Many are fascinated that someone can be adopted successfully as a young teen. I also defy the stereotypes of former foster youth. I don&#x2019;t have a criminal record. I&#x2019;d never been homeless or lived in poverty as an adult. I did not become a teen parent.<br> <br>&#x201c;I spent almost ten years in foster care, during which time I lived in fourteen different foster placements,&#x201d; I begin. If there are caseworkers or foster youth in the audience, there are often nods of recognition or nervous laughter. My story is hard to hear, I know&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s also difficult for me to recount over and over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Imagine being three years old,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;The police put your mother in one car and you and your baby brother in another. A few hours later caseworkers separate you from your brother. Nobody explains anything. That night you are in a shelter home, crying yourself to sleep. The next day you are moved again, and you then enter a world of ever-changing &#x2018;placements&#x2019; and &#x2018;beds,&#x2019; broken promises, confusion, and the overwhelming feeling that everything is your fault or that something is inherently wrong with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>My audiences are often well intentioned and dedicated to helping children, but my story reminds them of the crushing impact of their decisions. &#x201c;After seven years, my mother&#x2019;s parental rights were finally severed. Even though this was the only way for me to move on, it felt like she had died. I mourned her then, and in some ways I mourn her still&#x2014;even though she is now a peripheral part of my life. For several years after the termination of parental rights (TPR), or final legal separation, I remained in foster care, eventually landing in a children&#x2019;s home with a staff that helped me heal. I am one of the lucky ones who finally got out of the system. Even at the awkward age of twelve, the perfect family came forward to adopt me. You would have thought I would have been thrilled, but I had lived in so many hideous homes&#x2014;including with people who were later convicted of child abuse, molestation, and other felonies&#x2014;that I didn&#x2019;t trust anyone to be kind to me, let alone keep me more than a few months.<br> <br>&#x201c;On my adoption day I was sullen and wary; so when the judge asked if I wanted to be adopted, I mumbled, &#x2018;I guess so&#x2019;&#x2014;the three little words that were also the title of my first memoir.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yet none of the assumptions I made that day turned out to be true. Our family now laughs about the tug-of-war as they tried to welcome me into their fold while I pulled back with all my might. For years, I couldn&#x2019;t admit&#x2014;even to myself&#x2014;that I had left an ember burning in my heart for my biological mother, the person who had smothered me with kisses and called me affectionate names when she showed up for the infrequent visits social services arranged.<br> <br>&#x201c;My new life with Phil and Gay Courter seemed too good to be true. I had my own room and could have slumber parties. There were no locks on the cabinets or refrigerator. I always had someone to help me with my homework, and they were interested in whatever was happening in my life. I worried that one day they would discover I wasn&#x2019;t perfect and would send me back. To speed the process, I found ways to make my new parents quarrel with each other, and lied indiscriminately to keep them guessing. I tried pushing every button they had. I was admonished, but they did not reject me.&#x201d;<br> <br>This part of my speech always gets resounding applause&#x2014;not for me but for my adoptive parents. I&#x2019;ve told my story many times, and still the shame of my antics never fades. It&#x2019;s all part of my life. I don&#x2019;t like thinking of a time when I was cruel or withholding to someone who was trying to love me&#x2014;especially after having been on the other side of the equation while I was growing up. But my honest admissions illustrate a crucial point for me. I had no blueprint for healthy relationships; I had no maps or role models. I had to learn on my own that love means forgiveness at many levels.<br> <br>&#x201c;I began to trust in baby steps. When I felt accepted no matter what I did, I started to attach. That attachment led to love.&#x201d;<br> <br>I had been giving different versions of this speech since I was fourteen, but on this occasion my memorized patter sounded hollow. I wondered if anyone sensed that I felt as though I was standing on a precipice with a few pebbles of loose gravel beginning to fall with faint pings down into a valley so deep that I had no idea where they were landing. I have been to the edge many times before&#x2014;not knowing if I would finally return home to my mother or be shuffled to yet another temporary home run by people who were paid to house and feed me. This time, it was the summer after my senior year of high school, and I was about to voluntarily leave my first real sanctuary for college. All my friends were more than ready to get out from parental control, but my adoptive home was my first real refuge, and I hadn&#x2019;t really been there that long.<br> <br>I continued to speak, my mind swirling with the paradox of sounding secure while trying to navigate my way through new complications with boyfriends and my birth family. I took a deep breath. Audiences like to feel closure and hear a happy ending, but the reality was that my story was evolving every day. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thankful to the parents and professionals who dedicate their time to helping young people, especially those who assisted me during critical times. Without strong advocates, so many more would fall through the cracks with no one to speak for us.&#x201d; The audience rose to their feet, clapping. As the sound melted away, the chattering began. The little questions, the small talk, the compliments, and my responses made me seem like I had it all together. If only they knew how nervous I was to be going away to college&#x2014;or that my biological mother had just emerged from the shadows.<br> <br><br> <br>My birth mother, Lorraine, once asked my adoptive mother, &#x201c;When will Ashley get over it?&#x201d; &#x201c;It&#x201d; refers to everything and anything she did or did not do for me. Lorraine saw the past as a door that could be closed. I felt she wanted to pretend we were distant relatives who had just gotten to know each other for the first time and not have to acknowledge all the ways she broke my heart as a child, or all that I endured because of her actions. The dispensation she seeks is not mine to give. I was the baby, the toddler, the frightened little girl who yearned for her mother and believed her when she told me she would return. She said everything would be all right sometime, somehow, soon. Soon turned into a very long time, and &#x201c;all right&#x201d; was far different than either of us ever imagined.<br> <br>I spoke with Lorraine for the first time in five years when I was thirteen years old and had been living with the Courters for two years. Everyone assumes that after being moved fourteen times, adoption meant that the sun shone golden rays, a double rainbow appeared, and that I opened a magical door into a fairy-tale future. Not only did I distrust Phil and Gay, I had also been wrongly told that adoption meant I would never be able to see my birth mother again. There was a part of me that resented my adoption for taking her away from me&#x2014;even though she&#x2019;d never really been there for me in the first place. So it came as a surprise when Gay said, &#x201c;We have no objection to you communicating with Lorraine.&#x201d;<br> <br>I called her bluff. &#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You want her phone number?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; She handed me her phone.<br> <br>I passed it back to her. &#x201c;You dial and ask if she even wants to talk to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>The call was brief. When I assured Lorraine that I was thriving and was comfortable in my new life, she told me that I sounded like a &#x201c;stuck-up Valley girl.&#x201d; I threw the phone at Gay and ran out of the room before she saw my tears. Once again I had felt a tug from an invisible umbilical cord; and once again it had been slashed by a callous remark.<br> <br>Now and then Gay mentioned Lorraine, not realizing that hearing her name felt like a cheese grater scraping a layer of skin. &#x201c;You could write her a letter,&#x201d; Gay suggested.<br> <br>I pretended not to care, but I made her a card. Lorraine wrote back saying she had just married again, and she included some pictures. A few months later she announced that she had given birth to Autumn. The news sickened me because my half sister was born a few days before my birthday and had been given my middle name. This was tough news for me to process. I felt like I had been replaced.<br> <br>Thinking about Lorraine with a new baby reminded me of two other babies that had come after me: the tiny baby who died in infancy and my brother, Luke, whom I endlessly worried about.<br> <br>A few days later Gay picked me up from school. I found it easier to approach her when her attention was directed at driving. &#x201c;How can they let Lorraine take care of a new baby when her other children were taken away from her?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean social services?&#x201d; responded Gay, who had been a volunteer Guardian ad Litem&#x2014;or CASA child advocate&#x2014;for almost ten years before she met me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Why don&#x2019;t they place her in foster care before somebody hurts her?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see your point,&#x201d; Gay said, &#x201c;but your mother will be given a fair chance to take care of this baby. After all, she never physically harmed you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wanted to shout that I preferred Gay to call her plain &#x201c;Lorraine,&#x201d; because it stripped my biological mother of any power over me, creating the distance I needed to protect myself from my own raw feelings.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t we tell someone that the baby might not be safe?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We would need proof,&#x201d; Gay said. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;m in touch with your aunt and uncle. They&#x2019;ll let me know if anything goes sour.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you take her?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Caseworkers like to place siblings together.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gay laughed. &#x201c;How much do you like to change diapers?&#x201d;<br> <br>After that, Lorraine faded into the background. When I was a sophomore in high school, Lorraine contacted Gay.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lorraine wants to see you,&#x201d; Gay announced without preface.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do I have to?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay if you are curious,&#x201d; Gay said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s also fine if you want to skip it. Either way it won&#x2019;t hurt my feelings. Better the reality than the daydream.&#x201d;<br> <br>How did she know that I had never stopped having fantasies about living with Lorraine in some alternate universe? &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t mind meeting my baby sister,&#x201d; I admitted. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s almost two.&#x201d;<br> <br>We met at a sandwich restaurant for about an hour. I hadn&#x2019;t seen Lorraine in almost seven years. Autumn didn&#x2019;t look related to me. At least my South Carolina cousins had my vivid red hair, but Autumn&#x2019;s was mud brown like her mother&#x2019;s. Until I met my cousins and uncle, I had never seen other family members who shared so many of my features. I felt no connection to Lorraine&#x2019;s voice, mannerisms, or even her smell. Her laughs were forced, her voice ragged from smoking, and she spent more time shooting worried glances at the friend she&#x2019;d brought to help with Autumn than being attentive to me.<br> <br>On our way home, Phil asked, &#x201c;How was it for you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Weird. Not what I expected.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which was?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That I would know her&#x2014;that something would have clicked. It was like talking to a total stranger who happened to know a lot about me.&#x201d; I turned from Phil because his tender gaze reminded me of what I had not seen in Lorraine&#x2019;s eyes.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t see or hear from Lorraine for two years after that visit, but as technology changed, she began texting me. I&#x2019;d given my number to my uncle Sammie&#x2014;Lorraine&#x2019;s brother&#x2014;when he brought his family to attend my graduation from high school. He had suggested that we not invite Lorraine because she wasn&#x2019;t sober. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s taking care of my sister?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Most of the time she&#x2019;s living with her &#x2018;nana&#x2019;&#x2014;an old family friend who watches out for her.&#x201d; He promised they were in close touch and would step in if Autumn wasn&#x2019;t safe.<br> <br>Shortly after that, Lorraine texted me: 1ST RHODES 2 GO 2 COLLEGE!<br> <br>I simply responded: THX.<br> <br>By then I&#x2019;d lived with the Courters more than twice as long as I&#x2019;d ever lived with her, but maybe, I reasoned, she had been waiting, biding her time until I was an adult to start a relationship. I didn&#x2019;t know what to expect, but I didn&#x2019;t need a mother like I once did. The space in my heart I had once desperately wanted her to fill was by then brimming with the love and support of the Courters. I had a stable home and parents and adoptive brothers, Blake and Josh, who loved me and looked out for me. It was difficult to figure out how Lorraine would fit into my life&#x2014;and easy to imagine all the ways she wouldn&#x2019;t.</p><h2>Springwater</h2><p>Evangeline Keating came west because she had to: after her husband's passing, she needed to build a new life for her young daughter, and marrying a stranger from Montana Territory was her best chance.

Biding his time with the lovely Evangeline begins to feel dangerously close to setting up a real home. But as a reckless passion sparks between them, Scully and Evangeline discover a destiny -- and a passion -- as boundless as the open frontier.</p></p><p>Linda Lael Miller is the author of seventy historical and contemporary romance novels, many of which are set in the American West. She was awarded the Romance Writers of America&#39;s prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> <i>Montana Territory, 1870</i> </p><p> She would never, in her long, long life, forget that first sight of him, riding through fresh snow high as the breast of his Appaloosa stallion, with the sky broad and ice blue at his back. Never forget those gleaming golden moments when she thought he was someone he was not. </p><p> Abigail, her six-year-old daughter, stood beside her at the window, perched on an upturned crate and peering through breath-fogged glass. "Look, Mama, he's come for us! I <i>told</i> you he would -- isn't he spectacular?" </p><p> Evangeline Keating bit her lower lip, tying to diffuse the swell of reckless anticipation and plain fear rising within her. The rider was indeed "spectacular," at least in build; his shoulders looked muscular and broad under his fleece-lined leather coat, his legs were long and straight, and he handled the reins with an easy grace that testified to a deep affinity with horses. </p><p> She could not make out his features, nor the color of his hair, for he wore a battered hat, pulled down low over his face, no doubt as a protection against the cold wind of that morning when a heavy snow had arrived early, catching the landscape by surprise. </p><p> She didn't really need to see him clearly, for she carried his likeness in her reticule, and had studied it over and over again. "Spectacular," Evangeline echoed at last. She was thinking of what would be expected of her, once the ceremony had been performed, and almost, but not quite, regretting her decision to come west and marry Mr. John Keating, her late husband's prosperous cousin. It wasn't as though she'd had any real choice, after all. Charles had left her with nothing, willing his farm and other assets to his son, Mott, conceived of his first, true and sainted wife, Clara. </p><p> Mott had expected to inherit Evangeline, along with the property and his father's money, a prospect that still caused her to shudder whenever the thought overtook her in an unguarded moment. Their small Pennsylvania town had been depleted of eligible men, as had the surrounding countryside, owing to the ravages of the late and tragic conflict of arms, and Evangeline, left with no honorable means of support, was desperate to marry. </p><p> Just when she'd begun to fret that she would have to give in and accept Mott Keating as a mate -- his father, at least, had been a mild-tempered man, if not precisely kind -- the letter had arrived. Mr. John Keating, a lonely but well-situated rancher, wrote to extend his condolences. He also enclosed a murky tintype of himself and a bank draft of not inconsiderable size, made out to Evangeline. </p><p> If she cared to make the journey west, he stated, he would marry her and raise her daughter as his own. He claimed to be an easy-going man, God-fearing, with simple wants and expectations. He had been among the first to drive cattle up from Texas, and there was a good, sturdy house on his property, one that wouldn't let in the rain. He had a fine and trustworthy partner, who kept mostly to himself. The work was hard, he admitted, and the ranch was a lonely place, there being few folks about. There were virtually no women, no schools as yet, and no churches, although Mr. Jacob McCaffrey, who, with his wife, June-bug, ran the Springwater station, a stagecoach stop some ten miles away, could be persuaded to preach a sermon now and again. </p><p> Evangeline had packed her and Abigail's few belongings into a single trunk, and ridden the railroads from Philadelphia to St. Paul, where they had boarded the first of numerous stagecoaches, traveling across the Nebraska and Montana Territories. The journey had taken weeks, calling upon every personal resource of courage, stamina and persistence Evangeline possessed. Only hours ahead of last night's blizzard, exhausted, hungry and cold to the marrow of their bones, mother and daughter had at last reached the Springwater station, where the McCaffreys, had made them welcome. </p><p> The rider gained the barn, dismounted and, after dragging open the door, led the puffing horse inside. In a few minutes, he came out again, blowing clouds as he slogged toward the station. When he raised his head and saw Evangeline and Abigail at the window, a grin flashed across his face, as dazzling, in its own way, as the sun-washed snow. </p><p> Evangeline stepped back quickly, reached up to touch her hair, which was an unremarkable shade of blonde, by her reckoning, but very neatly tended. She was, at her own assessment, neither plain nor pretty, with her tall, sturdy frame and strong hands. She had brown eyes, good teeth, healthy skin, and a shy, rare smile. She knew how to work, she was honest, and she was smart with numbers and words. She could grow vegetables, raise chickens, milk cows, keep a clean house, cook and sew. All in all, she was quite adequate as wife material. </p><p> She shook out the skirts of her blue calico dress, musty from so many weeks closed up in the travel trunk, and when she looked up, her gaze collided with that of June-bug McCaffrey, a small, gracious woman with a compassionate manner. </p><p> Mrs. McCaffrey glanced at her husband, Jacob, who was seated near the natural-rock fireplace, mending a harness. He was a gentle soul, impressive in size, with a somber expression and a head full of dark hair. </p><p> "Now, June-bug," he said quietly, "don't go interferin' in this." </p><p> Evangeline had almost worked up the nerve to ask what he meant -- it wasn't the first such exchange between the two since she'd arrived and stated her intention to marry John Keating -- when there was a thunderous knock at the heavy door, only briefly preceding a rush of winter air and the entrance of the tall man she expected to marry. Behind her, Abigail, who hoped for a pony of her own, not to mention a father, fairly jumped up and down with excitement. </p><p> Evangeline might have introduced herself, indeed, she was just stepping forward to do so, when the newcomer swept off his hat, revealing a head of fair, sun-streaked hair. His finely made face was ruddy with cold, and the look in his eyes, a bright blue green, was at once curious and amused, chagrined and bold. </p><p> Evangeline's stomach, wedged into her throat only a moment before, plummeted back into its rightful place, landing with a sickening lurch. "You're not Mr. Keating," she managed. </p><p> He studied her for what seemed like a long time, his expression unreadable. Then, at last, he replied. 'No, ma'am," he said simply. "I'm not." </p><p> While Evangeline was absorbing his announcement -- Abigail, hovering at the edge of her vision, was still at last -- the man held his hat in both hands and nodded to the McCaffreys. "Jacob," he said, by way of acknowledgment "Miss June-bug." </p><p> "You'll want some hot coffee, after a ride like that," June-bug decreed, bustling between the three trestle tables set out for the service of guests, with the stove as her intended destination. She was trim, with brown hair only faintly touched with gray, radiant skin, and eyes of an intense blue. "Some breakfast, too, I'll bet. You sit yourself down." </p><p> Evangeline stood stock still, afraid to move or speak. The man might well be an emissary for her future husband, but an inner sense, coupled with the odd glances the McCaffreys had been passing back and forth, told her that something was very wrong. </p><p> Mr. McCaffrey, ever the gentleman, set his harnesses aside and stood, running his broad, work roughened hands down the sides of his black woolen trousers. "Mrs. Keating," he said, after clearing his throat once, "this here is Scully Wainwright. He's partners with Big John, there at the Circle JW. Scully, this is Mrs. Keating." </p><p> Woodenly, Evangeline put out a hand. Wainwright hesitated, then wrenched off his heavy leather gloves and reciprocated. "Mrs. Keating," he said. There was a steadiness in him that ran deep, she sensed that right away, and despite a slight twitch in his jawline, he didn't once try to skirt her gaze. </p><p> "I was expecting my future husband," she said. No sense in beating round the bush, Evangeline thought. </p><p> He sighed, thrust a hand through his wild-man hair. Whoever he was, he needed tending to; his beard was growing in, his hair was shaggy and up close she could see that his shirt-collar wanted turning. No doubt he had holes in the heels and toes of his socks, too. </p><p> "You better tell her straight out," Jacob said, taking Wainwright's coat and moving away. There was in Jacob's manner something of a man who has just flung a handful of gunpowder into a bonfire. </p><p> "I was hoping you would have done that already," came the rueful answer. Scully didn't look away from Evangeline as he spoke, but she could tell he wanted to, nonetheless. </p><p> Abigail had come forward now, to stand just behind Evangeline, clutching her mother's skirts with small, strong hands. </p><p> Jacob took up a place beside June-bug, at the other end of the long room, with its exposed beams, spotless tables and plank floors. They conferred quietly as they worked at busy, invented tasks, and made a point of paying no attention to the drama unfolding just out of earshot. </p><p> Wainwright gave another sigh. "Big John isn't here. Right now, it's just me, the ranch, and a few cattle," he said, all in one breath. </p><p> Evangeline considered what it would mean to journey back to Pennsylvania, persuade the scorned Mott to marry her after all, and felt her courage wane with such swiftness that she had to sit down on the bench beside the nearest table. Abigail clung to her even more fiercely now, all her attention fixed on the towering form of Scully Wainwright. </p><p> He must have looked like a giant to the little girl; even to Evangeline, he was Goliath. The obvious fact that he was the most reluctant of messengers made no difference. It appeared that she and Abigail had traveled a long, hard road for nothing. </p><p> "What," Evangeline forced herself to begin, "do you mean, Mr. Keating isn't here? He wrote to me, proposing matrimony. He sent a bank draft..." </p><p> Wainwright sat down at the end of the bench, straddling it, resting one elbow on the table. June-bug approached, set a steaming cup of coffee down beside him, and scurried away again. "Yes, ma'am, I know all that. But he had to head south on some business, and it took longer than expected. He won't be back till spring, most likely, with the trails the way they are." </p><p> Evangeline well knew the state of the trails. The stage that had brought her to Springwater station had barely made it through, after all, and though the driver had pressed on toward the next stop after taking a hot meat and helping Jacob hitch up a fresh team, there was no telling when another coach would come through. According to the McCaffreys, it could be weeks, if the weather didn't turn. </p><p> She hiked her chin up a notch, refusing to let her emotions show, lest it seem like some sort of concession. Except for Abigail, and her dignity, she had nothing at all. "What, may I ask, are we supposed to do with ourselves in the meantime?" </p><p> The broad shoulders moved in an easy shrug, but Mr. Wainwright did avert his gaze for a moment. "I reckon you ought to come to the ranch with me, ma'am. You can settle in there, and carry on with the wedding when Big John gets home in the spring." </p><p> Evangeline was both relieved and horrified, having gotten the distinct impression that Mr. Wainwright had been living and working alone on the Circle JW since his partner's departure. It was one thing to have a place to go, and quite another to share a domicile with a stranger, and a mate one, at that. </p><p> Abigail, uncharacteristically silent until then, peered around Evangeline's hip and inquired, "May I have a pony? I'd like a spotted one, though any color would do." </p><p> Wainwright smiled at that, and in so doing struck a chord somewhere inside Evangeline. The resulting emotional sensations, resonating within her like just strummed harp strings, seemed better left unexamined. "Snow's pretty deep," he replied. "All the same, there might be a yearling you could ride." </p><p> "Thank you," Abigail said solemnly, stepping for ward now and extending her small hand, as if to seat the bargain. She seemed impossibly delicate, with her birdlike bones, enormous china blue eyes, and pale skin, contrasted by midnight-dark ringlets, but in this case appearances were indeed deceptive. Abigail was country-bred, and despite her prim little dress and doll-like aspect, she was as vary and agile as any boy alive, and just as mischievous. Within her daughter's small breast, Evangeline thought, with mingled pride and consternation, beat the heart of a ruffian and a rascal. </p><p> Evangeline took a gentle hold on her daughter's hand and drew her back, though the bargain had clearly already been struck. There would be a pony for Abigail. That, Evangeline supposed, was some consolation, at least. </p><p> "I'm not sure this is proper," she said, looking hard at Mr. Wainwright. His face was sun-bronzed, which only enhanced the turquoise shade of his eyes and made his straight white teeth seem even whiter. "Unless, of course, you are a married man. If your wife were present..." </p><p> "No wife," he interrupted, and took a leisurely sip from the coffee June-bug had provided. There was no sign of the McCaffreys now, though their voices could be heard from the small storeroom off the kitchen area, raised in what sounded like an amiable argument. "But I can live in the tack room out in the barn, and Jacob and Miss June-bug will warrant that I'm not the sort to force..." Here, he glanced at Abigail, and had the good grace to blush a little, beneath that deep tan of his. "I am a gentleman, in all respects that ought to concern you, Mrs. Keating." </p><p> Evangeline believed him, even after all her confrontations and near misses with Mott, which had left her somewhat wary of men. Over the eight years of her marriage to Charles, however, she had cultivated her intuition, which told her that Wainwright presented no physical danger to her, or to Abigail. This was not to say that he was tame; everything in his manner and bearing indicated that he was as wild as the wolves and cougars stalking the foothills of this treacherous, uncivilized and incomprehensibly beautiful country. </p><p> Evangeline had no viable alternatives. Even if another coach came through, she hadn't nearly enough money left to buy passage all the way back to Pennsylvania. Mott would send funds, if she wrote to him contritely, but that would take months and besides, he would want her soul in return, as well as her body. Nor could she rightly impose further upon the hospitality of the McCaffreys. They had been kind, even generous, but it simply was not their responsibility to look after stranded women and their children. </p><p> That left traveling to the Circle JW and settling in to wait for Mr. Keating to return from whence he'd gone. At least, she thought gamely, she would not have to change her name when she remarried. Abigail would have a warm, safe home and, presumably, plenty to eat. And the prospect of having an entire winter to prepare herself for the duties of a wife was not without a certain appeal. </p><p> If indeed she could trust Mr. Wainwright -- an impression she would most certainly verify with the M...</p></p><h2>Big Ideas Math Advanced 1 A Balanced Approach (California Edition)</h2><p>2015 Big Ideas Math: A Balanced Approach Advanced 1 California Edition, A Common Core Curriculum (CA)(H) by Ron Larson &amp; Laurie Boswell ***ISBN-13: 9781608406739 ***703 Pages</p><p></p><h2>Girls in Pants: The Third Summer of the Sisterhood (Sisterhood of Traveling Pants, Book 3)</h2><p>The Pants first came to us at the perfect moment.

Best buds Tibby, Carmen, Lena and Bridget are back with their magical pair of shared jeans in <i>Girls in Pants: The Third Summer of the Sisterhood.</i> Each summer brings new and difficult challenges, as the perennially separated friends discover afresh this last season before college. Tibby struggles with the idea of close friend Brian becoming her boyfriend, and their fragile relationship is soon tested by a tragedy in her immediate family. Carmen doesn&#x2019;t know how to react when she finds out that her middle-aged mom is pregnant, and Bridget is unpleasantly surprised to be reunited with the boy who broke her heart two summers ago. Finally, Lena, still coming to terms with the loss of her first love, tries to convince her strict father that art school is a better career path than Greek restaurant management.

Even though he left to go to college, and then went on to a storied career in the famous Behavioral Science Unit of the FBI, he eventually returned to Cavanaugh Street after an early retirement. There he finds himself in a rapidly gentrifying urban neighborhood that still retains some of the friends, institutions, and flavor of the immigrant neighborhood he grew up in. Among them is his best friend, Father Tibor Kasparian, the parish priest of the local Armenian-Orthodox church, probably the most genuinely gentle soul that Demarkian has ever met. </p><p>When Father Tibor is then arrested on murder charges, it tears at the very foundation of Demarkian's world. While Gregor has very strict rules about for whom and under what conditions he will consult, all those rules go by the wayside. In <i>Fighting Chance</i>, from award-winning author Jane Haddam, Demarkian is now a man possessed, and his one goal is to find out what really happened and who is really responsible for the murder Father Tibor is charged with.</p></p><p>A finalist for both the Edgar and the Anthony Award, JANE HADDAM is best known for her mysteries featuring Gregor Demarkian. She lives in Litchfield County, Connecticut.<p>ONE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1</p> <p>Somewhere back in the mists of time, Gregor Demarkian had trained to be an accountant. First he had taken a degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania. That had sounded very practical to his parents, who were immigrants from Armenia and heavily invested in making sure their children had careers that could carry them in America. Gregor never had the heart to tell them that academic economics was not the same thing as a business degree. To this day, he wasn&#x2019;t sure what it was most of his professors had been getting at. Whether they were socialist or capitalist, mercantilist or Marxist, they all seemed to be living in cloud-cuckoo-land, where &#x201c;rational actors&#x201d; and &#x201c;historical forces&#x201d; bumped about the landscape doing things no actual existing human being would ever do, &#x201c;inevitably&#x201d; coming to conclusions that contradicted everybody else&#x2019;s inevitability.</p> <p>After college, Gregor went on to the Harvard Business School, where he&#x2019;d been given an MBA that should have been spectacularly practical. He&#x2019;d been enabled to go by the Armenian American Professional Fund, which was set up by an earlier generation of immigrants than that of his parents, dedicated to turning Armenian Americans into doctors and lawyers and that kind of thing.</p> <p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t go on and on with the rugs,&#x201d; the secretary of the fund explained to him when he&#x2019;d gone by to pick up an application. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s embarrassing. It&#x2019;s a stereotype. Nobody wants to be a stereotype.&#x201d;</p> <p>Gregor had been a contrarian even then, and something in the back of his mind observed that not only did everybody rely on stereotypes to get by in everyday life, but that it could sometimes be to your own advantage to be taken as one. Fortunately, he&#x2019;d had too much sense actually to say that. He&#x2019;d just taken the papers home, filled them out, and sent them in. Two months later, his tuition at Harvard was covered.</p> <p>His father thought he&#x2019;d been in school long enough already, but his mother was very pleased. &#x201c;They take you very seriously,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;You want to be taken seriously.&#x201d;</p> <p>Gregor supposed he did want to be taken seriously, but at the moment, it was mostly a side issue. He&#x2019;d done well at Wharton, and while he was doing very well, he had assumed that he would spend his life after graduating working for some enormous corporation, or for one of the Big Eight accounting firms. He&#x2019;d had his sights set on Arthur Andersen when the man from the FBI showed up at a recruitment day.</p> <p>From the moment he met the man from the FBI, he&#x2019;d been hooked.</p> <p>The problem as things now stood was that, although the FBI had hired him because he was an accountant&#x2014;in those days, the FBI preferred its recruits to be either lawyers or accountants&#x2014;it hadn&#x2019;t ever really used his expertise in accountancy.</p> <p>Part of that was his own damned fault. He&#x2019;d graduated. He&#x2019;d been sent off to get enough experience to be certified. He&#x2019;d trained at Quantico. In no time at all, he was able to see that the really interesting work in the Bureau had to do with bodies.</p> <p>For a while after that, Gregor kept up his certification and made some effort to keep up with accounting. But it was only for a while. Kidnapping detail had given way to murder investigations on Indian reservations and then to the early days of the Behavioral Sciences Unit. And after that, Elizabeth got sick with breast cancer.</p> <p>Gregor could not remember a time when he had been sorry that his career went the way it had gone. Until now. Now he was sitting at the Federal Reserve, waiting for an appointment and sifting through computer files. He had been sifting through these files for several weeks, and they still didn&#x2019;t make even a modicum of sense.</p> <p>He was rapidly reaching the conclusion that they were not making sense, because they could not be made sense of.</p> <p>He heard a discreet little cough near the top of his head and looked up to find a middle-aged woman standing over him, looking faintly disapproving. Gregor did not take that seriously. This was a confidential secretary of the old school&#x2014;not a woman who typed and took dictation, but a woman who manged five or six other secretaries underneath her and knew more about what her boss did than her boss himself. She knew because she was convinced that bosses knew next to nothing, and she was probably right.</p> <p>&#x201c;Mr. Carpenter is ready for you now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ll just follow me this way.&#x201d;</p> <p>Gregor said thank you and got up and followed. It had been many years since he was last inside the Federal Reserve, and he was both surprised and a little depressed to see that it had changed almost not at all.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t very far to Mr. Carpenter&#x2019;s office. It was just off the reception area to the right and barely down the corridor. Whoever Mr. Carpenter was, he was not a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>That made Gregor Demarkian decidedly relieved.</p> <p>The middle-aged woman stopped at a blank wooden door, knocked twice, and opened it.</p> <p>A young man stood up from behind a solid wood desk and held out his hand. &#x201c;Mr. Demarkian? I&#x2019;m Terry Carpenter. The Director has told me a lot about you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Gregor could not imagine what the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had had to tell Terry Carpenter about him. This was not a Director under which Gregor had ever worked. He wasn&#x2019;t even the second Director after one under which Gregor had worked.</p> <p>Gregor shook Terry Carpenter&#x2019;s hand and sat down in one of the seats the man was gesturing to. The office was only big-ish. Gregor wondered what Carpenter spent most of his time doing.</p> <p>Terry Carpenter sat down behind his desk again. Gregor put his briefcase on the floor.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;m actually the person you need to talk to,&#x201d; Carpenter said. &#x201c;We looked through the material you sent the Bureau, and we tried to work it out, but you have to understand that these things are very complicated. Worse than complicated.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Bat shit crazy&#x2019; is what Mike Engstrom told me.&#x201d;</p> <p>Carpenter flushed slightly. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know. And I hate to admit it, but I think it&#x2019;s actually getting worse.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been years,&#x201d; Gregor pointed out. &#x201c;The mortgage meltdown was in 2008. And you don&#x2019;t know anything?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; Carpenter said. &#x201c;We know a lot. We&#x2019;re just not sure what we know is right, and we&#x2019;re not sure what else is out there, and as to the problem of titles&#x2014;well.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;When you take a mortgage and slice it into a dozen pieces and sell the pieces to a dozen different funds that sell securities based on the pieces to hundreds of different clients, it begins to get to be a problem figuring out who actually owns the property.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what your e-mail said,&#x201d; Gregor poined out.</p> <p>Carpenter flushed again. &#x201c;I know. It&#x2019;s going to be years yet before we get this all straightened out, and we may <i>never</i> get this straightened out. There may be hundreds of properties out there without any clear title at all&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You mean people are going to be living in houses and nobody&#x2019;s going to know who owns them.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the thing,&#x201d; Carpenter said. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m only interested in one property,&#x201d; Gregor said. &#x201c;Apartment Four, 1207 Markham Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It&#x2019;s right around the corner from my house. The man who lives there is named Mikel Dekanian. He immigrated from Armenia fifteen years ago. He&#x2019;s got a wife named Asha and two children, both boys. The boys are both under ten.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Carpenter said. &#x201c;But you must realize that as affecting as these personal stories are&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just that their house is in foreclosure. It&#x2019;s that their house is in foreclosure due to the legal action of a bank that, as far as I can figure out, never had a mortgage on the house. Never. You can do things about a foreclosure if you know how to go about it right. But I can&#x2019;t do anything about a foreclosure when the bank that&#x2019;s foreclosing doesn&#x2019;t actually hold the mortgage on the house. And I really can&#x2019;t do anything about it when everybody admits that the bank doesn&#x2019;t seem to have the right to foreclose, but nobody will stop them from foreclosing. This ought not even to be an issue. We should have been able to go into court, show the judge that the bank did not have the lien, and walked out with the foreclosure stopped.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Carpenter said miserably. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Instead,&#x201d; Gregor said, &#x201c;the court is acting as if Mikel Dekanian is pulling some kind of scam, and as if I&#x2019;m aiding and abetting it. And the priest from our local church. And my wife. And before you say yes again, let me point out that this isn&#x2019;t the only case like this we&#x2019;ve had. There have, in fact, been four of these cases over the last three years in our own parish alone, and we lost one of them.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m feeling a little stuck on yes,&#x201d; Terry Carpenter said.</p> <p>&#x201c;And does yes mean there&#x2019;s nothing you can do about it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; Terry Carpenter said. &#x201c;Give me a minute and let me show you what I&#x2019;ve managed to put together.&#x201d;</p> <p>2</p> <p>What Terry Carpenter had managed to put together was an even bigger mess than what Gregor Demarkian had managed to put together for himself, and it was far more surreal.</p> <p>&#x201c;I just have to do a little setup here,&#x201d; he promised while Gregor sat in his uncomfortable visitor&#x2019;s chair and watched the razzle-dazzle roll out in the hands of two assistants who looked far more nervous than they ought to be.</p> <p>Gregor was willing to bet that these were not Terry Carpenter&#x2019;s own personal assistants, and the ferociously competent woman who had brought him to Carpenter&#x2019;s door wasn&#x2019;t either. The ferociously competent woman would belong to a higher-up who wanted to make sure Carpenter made a good impression. Carpenter wasn&#x2019;t making a good impression.</p> <p>He was barely making a bad impression.</p> <p>Computers rolled into the office, mostly laptops with very big screens. These were lined up on the edge of Carpenter&#x2019;s desk facing Gregor. The screens of the laptops all had very colorful graphs on them&#x2014;bar graphs and pie graphs, overlapping circle graphs that reminded Gregor of elementary school forays into set theory. The whole thing gave off a distinct odor of panic.</p> <p>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; Carpenter said. &#x201c;There we are. I think that if we refer to these graphs, I might be able to explain what&#x2019;s going on with your Mr., uh, Mr.&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mikel Dekanian,&#x201d; Gregor said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Carpenter said.</p> <p>Gregor gave the computer screens a sweep. &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really need to understand what&#x2019;s going on here. What I need is to find out what I have to do to fix it. I have a young man who&#x2019;s done that thing we&#x2019;re always talking about, and played by all the rules. He&#x2019;s never been late on a mortgage paper in his life. He hasn&#x2019;t dealt with any of the big banks exactly because he&#x2019;s heard too much about the way they operate. And in spite of all that, he&#x2019;s got letters threatening to send officers to his door. And&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It really would help if you understood it,&#x201d; Terry Carpenter said. &#x201c;It will only take a minute.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d let it go and laugh it off if it wasn&#x2019;t for the case we had last year,&#x201d; Gregor said. &#x201c;I mean, for God&#x2019;s sake, if something like this had come up twenty years ago, it would have been resolved in a week and the bank would have been falling all over Mikel, trying to pay him enough not to sue&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s just it!&#x201d; Terry Carpenter said frantically. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just it! Twenty years ago, the lien would have been filed on paper in your local property tax jurisdiction, somebody would have taken a paper copy of the lien down to the wherever it is, wherever you file deeds and liens on the deeds&#x2014;it would be the town hall in most places, but with a city the size of Philadelphia, I&#x2019;m just not sure, so you see&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you trying to say that Mikel&#x2019;s deed isn&#x2019;t on file with the real estate office? Because I can tell you&#x2019;re wrong. It&#x2019;s there. I&#x2019;ve seen it. What&#x2019;s more, what isn&#x2019;t there is any lien whatsoever besides the mortgage from the American Amity Savings Bank. I know. I went down there and looked myself.&#x201d;</p> <p>Terry Carpenter seemed to be trying to get control of himself.</p> <p>Gregor thought he&#x2019;d head him off at the pass.</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try to tell me that American Amity sold the mortgage,&#x201d; Gregor said, &#x201c;because I know it didn&#x2019;t. American Amity never sold any of its mortgages. I checked it out.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Terry Carpenter said, &#x201c;but the thing is&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And if you&#x2019;re going to try to tell me that Mikel took out a second mortgage with J.P. CitiWells, you&#x2019;re going to have to show me the paperwork. Mikel said he didn&#x2019;t, and I believe him. I believe him because I know him. I believe him because there is no record of such a lien in the city records. And I believe him because less than a year ago, we had a case where this same bank tried to foreclose on a house that hadn&#x2019;t had a mortgage on it for nearly thirty years. No mortgage at all. Free and clear.&#x201d;</p> <p>Terry Carpenter had been standing up, leaning toward the open laptops, as if he needed only a break in the conversation to jump in and get going. Now he sat down again with a thud.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You got one of those.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>One</i> of those?&#x201d; Gregor asked.</p> <p>Carpenter looked defensive. &#x201c;There weren&#x2019;t many of them,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I mean, hardly a thousand all told throughout the entire system&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You had a <i>thousand</i> cases where banks tried to foreclose on houses without any mortgages on them at all? None? A thousand cases&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I keep trying to tell you,&#x201d; Carpenter said. &#x201c;Everybody used to register their deeds and their mortgages at town hall, but back around 2000, people began to feel that was a really old-fashioned and time-consuming way of going about things. You had to hire people to go running all over the country. It could take weeks to get mortgage liens filed. So a group of the bigger banks got together to found an electronic filing database, one big database for the entire country. Which was not entirely stupid, you have to see that&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Was it legal?&#x201d; Gregor asked. &#x201c;Is it legal?&#x201d;</p> <p>Terry Carpenter looked miserable. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Gregor said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a man with a wife and two small children about to lose his house over a mortgage he never took out, and you don&#x2019;t know if the way it was filed was legal&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There are a lot of different jurisdictions involved,&#x201d; Terry Carpenter said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s legal in California isn&#x2019;t necessarily legal in Nevada. What&#x2019;s legal in Atlanta isn&#x2019;t necessarily legal in Savannah.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know about jurisdictions,&#x201d; Gregor said.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to say that the banks should have stuck to the old system,&#x201d; Terry Carpenter said, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;ve got to see that that isn&#x2019;t going to be sustainable. We live in a digital age. You don&#x2019;t type on a manual typewriter anymore, and you don&#x2019;t vote by paper ballot. We really are going to have to do something about updating the recordkeeping&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mikel Dekanian&#x2019;s house is in jeopardy because you hired a bunch of cut-rate data entry people, didn&#x2019;t hire enough of them, made them work like crazy, and they made mistakes. Lots of mistakes. Some of which&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;After all,&#x201d; Terry Carpenter said. &#x201c;They really were just mistakes. The banks aren&#x2019;t deliberately trying to steal people&#x2019;s houses out from under them&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to expect that there are going to be some glitches when a new system goes into place,&#x201d; Terry Carpenter said, sailing right past anything Gregor was saying. &#x201c;The thing to do, right this minute, is to get your proof together&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have proof,&#x201d; Gregor said, &#x201c;and we shouldn&#x2019;t be the ones trying to prove anything. J.P. CitiWells should be producing the loan documents, which they are not, and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;&#x2014;and then it&#x2019;s just a matter of time,&#x201d; Terry Car...</p></p><h2>The Asterisk War: The Academy City on the Water, Vol. 1 - manga (The Asterisk War Manga, 1)</h2><p>The school-city of Rokka-also known as &#39;Asterisk.&#39; Here boys and girls of the Starpulse Generation all compete in the Seibusai-the &#39;star battle festival,&#39; fighting for glory on the greatest combat entertainment stage of the world.

The history of the cathedral's construction, as well as its restoration in the nineteenth century, is recounted in detail in this exhaustive study. Particular attention is also devoted to the building's abundant sculpture, especially the moving remnants of the twelfth- and thirteenth-century programs now preserved in the Musee de Cluny.</p><p>If you're going to Paris, chances are you'll drop by Notre-Dame.

Get comfortable, pour yourself a glass of wine, and settle into the history, design, and interior of one of man's greatest monuments to God. From the 4th-century cathedral to the exquisite iconography of the western facade's portrayal of the Last Judgment, it's a structure deeply deserving of the loving treatment Erlande- Brandenburg and Rose bestow. And when you're there in the flesh, you'll appreciate the flying buttresses and stained-glass windows better for every picture detail and insightful note you studied before you left. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i>The cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris is one of the jewels of the French capital and a masterpiece of Gothic architecture.

The book presents an intimate look at a man who had the longest law-making career in American history, having served in the House of Representatives for 49 years at the time of his death in 1961. As Speaker of the House, "Mr. Sam" epitomized honesty and integrity in public service. Referred to here as "arguably the most underrated public official in twentieth-century politics," he is revealed as a major architect of New Deal legislation, adviser to presidents from Wilson to Kennedy, and a man whose "outrageously optimistic dreams came true." Rayburn's legislative battles are described in detail, from his confrontation with public-utility holding companies in the '30s to his last major victory, a showdown with conservatives over control of the House Committee on Rules. Also covered are Truman's reliance on the Speaker's counsel and the father-son relationship between Rayburn and his protege, Lyndon Johnson. An inspiring portrait of a politician who may have been the last of his kind.

This concept has profound implications for anyone who is trying to understand the poems which present every reader with challenges of reference to local and international events, autobiography, religious belief, trades, agriculture, philosophy, theology, aesthetics, culture-the actual list is much longer. Add to this the matter of how the poems sound: meter, rhythm, Anglo-Saxon alliteration and primordial diction, tempo, dynamics. This Hopkins Country is rich and varied. To make one's way through it one needs a guide. MacKenzie is that guide, almost as Vergil was Dante's guide through three levels of another country (and Dante made it up!).<br>The best guide in any country is a well-worn footsoldier who has weathered and worked the terrain, not a temp like the rest of us who parachute in, or hover above a lovely spot or bird in flight and pontificate on this or that view or inscape, and then like a hummingbird or bee, fly off to another country. Reading Hopkins is work, as MacKenzie reported of his encounter in 1945 with the poet: "Hopkins was invitingly difficult, obviously worth exploring." At that point MacKenzie started an apprenticeship on the ground, in the field, that imperceptibly changed to lifetime mastery. For 57 years Norman MacKenzie was the senior tenant of that country. Paradoxically, he lived longer with Hopkins than Hopkins lived with himself. Hopkins died before he was 45. And when in 2004, just short of reaching the age of 89, MacKenzie died, he was bringing his precious Reader's Guide into the new century. His daughter, Catherine Phillips, as worthy a Hopkins scholar and editor as she is a daughter, with filial discretion has completed the revision, leaving most of the text as it was-most of us felt it could have been reprinted as it was-but taking note of scholarship and editing that have happened since 1981. The voice is still unmistakably that of Norman MacKenzie.<br><br>What makes MacKenzie's book different? Precisely that lifetime of familiarity with the Country that the rest of us really just plan on visiting. For the armchair traveler, a map and descriptions of anywhere are likely to be enough. But not for an explorer. To try to read Hopkins the way one reads a map is to distort the Hopkins Country, like the world, to flatness. The true world is configured in infinitely varied ways. So too the Hopkins Country. Norman MacKenzie put it this way in the Preface to the 1981 edition: to the reader "on foot, healthily determined to follow the poet's trail, [existing specialized studies] seldom supply the mile-by-mile direction he needs. It is for him that A Reader's Guide to Gerard Manley Hopkins is intended, designed . . . to accompany the author through the poems in more or less chronological sequence. The territory, too rugged for the taste of his own contemporaries, is on that account all the more inviting to us today."<br>Generations of students and instructors have treasured their rare copies of the 1981 edition, as they were unable to share the compendium of that Country as a gift to friends. Small as the book seems (277 pages), it is an encyclopedia of knowledge. There is a brief chronology of the life and interests of Hopkins, followed by 230 pages of guidance through the poems in the form of facts about the composition, manuscript variations, interpretations, paraphrases, and critical disagreements. A recently discovered playful poem is printed with commentary. An enlightening reference section of poetic terms and biographical notes on the poet's friends is followed by a select bibliography and full index.</p><p></p><h2>A Pilgrim&#39;s Guide to the Camino de Santiago: St. Jean - Roncesvalles - Santiago (Camino Guides)</h2><p>Now updated to include newer maps and photos - and lighter in weight to support carefree traveling - this comprehensive guidebook to the Camino de Santiago and its offshoots contains all the information needed by modern-day pilgrims wishing to walk the sacred Way of St. James.

U.S. government officials then faced the task of transforming Japan from enemy to ally, not only in top-level diplomatic relations but also in the minds of the American public.&nbsp;Only ten years after World War II, this transformation&nbsp;became a success&nbsp;as middle-class American consumers across the country were embracing Japanese architecture, films, hobbies, philosophy, and religion. Cultural institutions on both sides of the Pacific along with American tastemakers promoted a new image of Japan in keeping with State Department goals. Focusing on traditions instead of modern realities, Americans came to view Japan as a nation that was sophisticated and beautiful yet locked harmlessly in a timeless &#x201c;Oriental&#x201d; past. What ultimately led many Americans to embrace Japanese culture was a desire to appear affluent and properly &#x201c;tasteful&#x201d; in the status-conscious suburbs of the 1950s.<br><br> In <i>How to Reach Japan by Subway</i>, Meghan Warner Mettler studies the <i>shibui </i>phenomenon, in which middle-class American consumers embraced Japanese culture while still exoticizing this new aesthetic. By examining <i>shibui</i> through the popularity of samurai movies, <i>ikebana</i> flower arrangement, bonsai cultivation, home and garden design, and Zen Buddhism, Mettler provides a new context and perspective for understanding how Americans encountered a foreign nation in their everyday lives.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Meghan Warner Mettler</b> is an assistant professor of history at Upper Iowa University.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;"Mettler's study does a fine job of bringing much nuance and texture to the place of Japan in postwar American life and culture."&#x2014;Mari Yoshihara,&nbsp;<i>Journal of American History</i> (Mari Yoshihara <i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A wonderful contribution to our knowledge in the field of twentieth-century U.S. history, American studies, Asian American studies, and America in the world.

Weber Series in the New Borderlands History)</h2><p>With the railroad's arrival in the late nineteenth century, immigrants of all colors rushed to the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, transforming the region into a booming international hub of economic and human activity. Following the stream of Mexican, Chinese, and African American migration, Julian Lim presents a fresh study of the multiracial intersections of the borderlands, where diverse peoples crossed multiple boundaries in search of new economic opportunities and social relations. However, as these migrants came together in ways that blurred and confounded elite expectations of racial order, both the United States and Mexico resorted to increasingly exclusionary immigration policies in order to make the multiracial populations of the borderlands less visible within the body politic, and to remove them from the boundaries of national identity altogether.<br><br>Using a variety of English- and Spanish-language primary sources from both sides of the border, Lim reveals how a borderlands region that has traditionally been defined by Mexican-Anglo relations was in fact shaped by a diverse population that came together dynamically through work and play, in the streets and in homes, through war and marriage, and in the very act of crossing the border.<br><br></p><p>Julian Lim is assistant professor of history at Arizona State University.What makes this study original is its substantive inclusion of Chinese, Black, and Mexicano histories within a single frame. Lim's innovative treatment of this material will push immigration and race historians to consider longer chronologies and dynamics at play in the borderlands.--Kelly Lytle Hernandez, author of <i>City of Inmates</i><br>With lucid prose and binational archival depth, Julian Lim illuminates a key era and location in borderlands history.&nbsp;Starting with the cartographic expedition of 1848, Lim traces the construction of the El Paso&#x2013;Juarez area as a political and economic engine of empire and border control and the ways that its multiracial, mixed-race denizens contested this process. Full of previously untold stories, this book stands to remap our understanding of the border.--Rachel Ida Buff, University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee<br><br></p><h2>PATRICK HERON ST IVES ARTISTS /ANGLAIS</h2><p>Patrick Heron held a unique position in twentieth-century art.

As a critic he produced a powerful and provocative body of writings, making a forceful case for the importance of contemporary British art.<br>Michael McNay provides a much-needed survey of Heron's life and work, exploring his close and creative relationship with the landscape and light of Cornwall, and his long investigation into the 'colour of colour'.

Some other author might have written the sentence, "Playing the game provided sanctuary, refuge from a hostile world." Only Wideman would follow it with, "Only trouble was, to reach the court we had left our women behind," and only Wideman would close a book about playground basketball with a letter to his grandmother. In between, he contrasts the sport with the craft of writing; mingles memories of learning to play with recollections of growing up in Pittsburgh; invokes the lover he found after his 30-year marriage broke up ("Turning this into a basketball game, aren't you, Mr. Hoopster?" she says at one point during their affair); talks about minstrel shows and African American music; and pits the purity and democracy of schoolyard ball against the professional sport, in which "a chosen few, players certified to be the very best, perform for pay as entertainers." You'll need to read it all to appreciate the way Wideman masterfully weaves together these diverse strands; suffice it to say that the importance of basketball to black men in a racist society, though a crucial subject here, is too straightforward to be the entire topic. "The deepest, simplest subject of this hoop book is pleasure," he writes, and he conveys that sensation to his readers on several different levels: the excitement of a superb description (men playing on a Greenwich Village court); the satisfaction of shrewd cultural analysis (why poor kids wear expensive clothes to play); the power of metaphor (the searing chapter titled "Who Invented the Jump Shot (A Fable)"); and most of all the thrill of watching an artist at the top of his game. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>John Edgar Wideman won the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1984 for Sent for You Yesterday and in 1990 for Philadelphia Fire.

She paused, thinking Nick might invite her in for a drink, but no invitation seemed forthcoming. Finally she said as nonchalantly as possible, &#x201c;This is quite a place&#x2014;is it your grandmother&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Nick replied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Has she lived here a long time?&#x201d; Peik Lin asked, craning to get a better look.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Since she was a young girl.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Peik Lin really wanted to ask was,&nbsp;<i>Who on earth is your grandmother?</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, you two have a great time,&#x201d; she said instead, winking at Rachel and mouthing&nbsp;<i>Call me later.</i>&nbsp;Rachel gave her friend a quick smile.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick turned to Rachel, looking a little sheepish. &#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s OK . . . but it&#x2019;s not just the family. My grandmother decided to have a small party at the last minute because her&nbsp;<i>tan hua</i>&nbsp;flowers are going to bloom tonight.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s throwing a party because some flowers are in bloom?&#x201d; Rachel asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, these are very rare. They bloom only about once every decade, and only at night. The whole thing lasts just a few hours. It&#x2019;s quite something.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sounds cool, but now I&#x2019;m feeling really underdressed,&#x201d; Rachel said, eyeing the fleet of limousines lining the driveway. She was wearing a sleeveless, chocolate-colored linen dress, a pair of low-heeled sandals, and the only expensive piece of jewelry she owned&#x2014;Mikimoto pearl studs that her mother had given her when she got her doctorate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not at all&#x2014;you look absolutely perfect,&#x201d; Nick replied.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they entered the house, Rachel was transfixed for a few moments by the intricate black, blue, and coral mosaic tile pattern on the floor of what appeared to be a large foyer. Then, to her amazement, a tall, spindly Indian man standing next to a table clustered with pots of enormous white-and-purple phalaenopsis orchids bowed ceremoniously to her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s upstairs in the living room,&#x201d; Nick said, leading Rachel toward a carved-stone staircase. She saw something out of the corner of her eye and let out a quick gasp. By the side of the staircase lurked a huge tiger, mouth open in a ferocious growl.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It looks so real!&#x201d; Rachel said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;real,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a native Singaporean tiger. They used to roam this area. My great-grandfather shot it when it ran into the house and hid under the billiard table, or so the story goes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Poor guy,&#x201d; Rachel said.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It used to scare the hell out of me when I was little. I never dared go near the foyer at night,&#x201d; Nick said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You grew up here?&#x201d; Rachel asked in surprise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, until I was about seven.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You never told me you lived in a palace.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a palace. It&#x2019;s just a big house.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nick, where I come from, this is a palace,&#x201d; Rachel said, gazing up at the cast-iron-and-glass cupola soaring above them. The murmur of party chatter and piano keys wafted down. As they entered the drawing room, Rachel felt momentarily giddy, as if she had been transported back in time to the grand lounge of a twenties ocean liner, en route from Venice to Istanbul, perhaps.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &#x201c;living room,&#x201d; as Nick so modestly called it, was a gallery that ran along the entire northern end of the house, with Art Deco divans, wicker club chairs, and ottomans casually grouped into intimate seating areas. A row of tall plantation doors opened onto a veranda, inviting a view of verdant parklands and the scent of night-blooming jasmine into the room. At the far end of the room a young man in a tuxedo played on a B�sendorfer grand piano. Rachel longed to study every exquisite detail: the exotic potted palms in massive Qianlong dragon jardinieres, the lacquered teak surfaces, the silver-and-lapis-lazuli-filigreed walls. The glamorous guests, she couldn&#x2019;t help noticing, appeared completely at ease lounging on the shantung silk ottomans while a retinue of white-gloved servants circulated with trays of cocktails.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Here comes my cousin Astrid&#x2019;s mother,&#x201d; Nick muttered. A stately-&nbsp;looking lady approached them, wagging a finger at Nick.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nicky, you naughty boy, why didn&#x2019;t you tell us you were back?&#x201d; The woman spoke in a clipped English accent straight out of a Merchant Ivory film. Rachel couldn&#x2019;t help but notice how her tightly permed black hair fittingly resembled the Queen of England&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So sorry, I thought you and Uncle Harry would be in London at this time of the year.&nbsp;<i>Dai gu cheh</i>, this is my girlfriend, Rachel Chu. Rachel, this is my auntie Felicity Leong.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felicity nodded at Rachel, boldly scanning her up and down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So nice to meet you,&#x201d; Rachel said, unsettled by her hawklike gaze.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is Astrid here yet?&#x201d; Nick asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Aiyah</i>, you know that girl is always late!&#x201d; At that moment, his aunt noticed an elderly Indian woman in a gold-and-peacock-blue sari being helped up the stairs. &#x201c;Dear Mrs. Singh, when did you get back from Udaipur?&#x201d; she screeched, pouncing on the woman as Nick guided Rachel out of the way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who is that lady?&#x201d; Rachel asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Mrs. Singh, a family friend who used to live down the street. She&#x2019;s the daughter of a maharaja and was great friends with Nehru. I&#x2019;ll introduce you later, when my aunt isn&#x2019;t breathing down our necks.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Her sari is absolutely stunning,&#x201d; Rachel remarked, gazing at the elaborate gold stitching.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I hear she flies all her saris back to New Delhi to be specially cleaned,&#x201d; Nick said as he tried to escort Rachel toward the bar, unwittingly steering her into the path of a very posh-looking middle-aged couple. The man had a pompadour of Brylcreemed black hair while his wife wore a classic gold-buttoned red-and-white Chanel suit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Uncle Dickie, Auntie Nancy, meet my girlfriend, Rachel Chu,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;Rachel, this is my uncle and his wife, from the T&#x2019;sien side of the family.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, Rachel, I&#x2019;ve met your grandfather in Taipei . . . Chu Yang Chung, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Uncle Dickie asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Er . . . actually, no. My family isn&#x2019;t from Taipei,&#x201d; Rachel stammered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh. Where are they from, then?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Guangdong originally, and nowadays California.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle Dickie looked a bit taken aback, while his well-coiffed wife grasped his arm tightly and continued. &#x201c;Oh, we know California very well. Northern California, actually.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m from,&#x201d; Rachel replied politely.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, well then, you must know the Gettys? Ann is a great friend of mine,&#x201d; Nancy effused.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Um, are you referring to the Getty Oil family?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is there any other?&#x201d; Nancy asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Rachel&#x2019;s from Cupertino, not San Francisco, Auntie Nancy. And that&#x2019;s why I need to introduce her to Francis Leong over there, who I hear is going to Stanford this fall,&#x201d; Nick cut in, quickly moving Rachel along. The next half hour was a blur of nonstop greetings, as Rachel was introduced to aunties and uncles and cousins, the distinguished though diminutive Thai ambassador, and the sultan of some unpronounceable Malay state, along with his two wives in bejeweled head scarves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One woman seemed to command the attention of the room. She was very slim and aristocratic-looking with snow-white hair and ramrod-straight posture, dressed in a long white silk cheongsam. Most of the guests orbited around her, paying tribute, and when she at last came toward them, Rachel noticed Nick&#x2019;s resemblance to her. Rachel decided to greet her in Mandarin, but before Nick could make proper introductions, she bowed her head nervously and said, &#x201c;It is such a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for inviting me to your beautiful home.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman looked at her quizzically and replied slowly in Mandarin, &#x201c;It is a pleasure to meet you, too, but you are mistaken; this is not my house.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Rachel, this is my great-aunt Rosemary,&#x201d; Nick explained hurriedly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ll have to forgive me, my Mandarin is really quite rusty,&#x201d; Great-Aunt Rosemary added in a Vanessa Redgrave English.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; Rachel said, her cheeks flushing bright red. She could feel all eyes in the room upon her, amused by her faux pas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No need to apologize.&#x201d; Great-Aunt Rosemary smiled graciously. &#x201c;Nick has told me quite a bit about you, and I was so looking forward to meeting you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick put his arm around Rachel and said, &#x201c;Here, come meet my grandmother.&#x201d; They walked across the room, and on the sofa closest to the veranda sat an older woman dressed simply in a rose-colored silk blouse and tailored cream trousers, her steel-gray hair held in place by an ivory headband. Standing behind her were two ladies in immaculate matching gowns of iridescent silk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick addressed his grandmother in Cantonese. &#x201c;<i>Ah ma</i>, I&#x2019;d like you to meet my friend Rachel Chu, from America.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So nice to meet you!&#x201d; Rachel blurted, forgetting her Mandarin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick&#x2019;s grandmother peered up at Rachel. &#x201c;Thank you for coming,&#x201d; she replied haltingly, in English, before turning to resume her conversation with a woman at her side. The two ladies swathed in silk stared inscrutably at Rachel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get some punch,&#x201d; Nick said, directing Rachel toward a table dominated by a huge Venetian glass punch bowl.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That had to be the most awkward moment of my life,&#x201d; Rachel whispered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nonsense. She was just in the middle of another conversation,&#x201d; Nick said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who were those two elegant women in matching silk dresses standing like statues behind her?&#x201d; Rachel asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Her lady&#x2019;s maids. They never leave her side. They&#x2019;re from Thailand and were trained to serve in the royal court.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is this a common thing in Singapore? Importing royal maids from Thailand?&#x201d; Rachel asked incredulously.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe so. This service was a special lifetime gift to my grandmother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A gift? From whom?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The King of Thailand.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Rachel said. She took the glass of punch from Nick and noticed that the fine etching on the Venetian glassware perfectly matched the intricate fretwork pattern on the ceiling. She leaned against the back of a sofa for support.There was so much for her to take in. Who knew that Nick&#x2019;s family would turn out to be so grand? And why hadn&#x2019;t he prepared her better?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned around to see Nick&#x2019;s cousin, Astrid Leong, holding a sleepy toddler. &#x201c;Astrid!&#x201d; she cried, delighted to see a friendly face. Astrid was wearing the chicest outfit Rachel had ever seen&#x2014;an embroidered Alexis Mabille white peasant blouse, pearl-gray Lanvin cigarette pants, and a fantastical pair of bejeweled earrings, very Millicent Rogers. So this was Astrid in her natural habitat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hello, hello!&#x201d; Astrid said cheerily. &#x201c;Cassian, say hi to Auntie Rachel.&#x201d; The child stared at Rachel, then buried his head into his mother&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;how are you finding Singapore so far? Having a good time?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A great time! Although tonight&#x2019;s been a bit . . . overwhelming.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I can only imagine,&#x201d; Astrid said with a knowing glint in her eye.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A melodious peal rang out. An elderly woman in a white cheongsam top and black silk trousers was playing a small silver xylophone by the stairs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, the dinner gong,&#x201d; Astrid said. &#x201c;Come, let&#x2019;s eat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;nb...</p></p><h2>Marking the Sparrow&#39;s Fall: Wallace Stegner&#39;s American West (A John Macrae Book)</h2><p>Presents a collection of essays, including fifteen published for the first time, along with the novella &#34;Genesis&#34;</p><p>Born on an Iowa farm in 1909, Wallace Stegner was of the last generation to see the frontier West. His father, Stegner recalled in an autobiographical essay, was a land speculator who dragged his family from one dusty Western town to another in search of easy riches, and who "died broke and friendless in a fleabag hotel, having in his lifetime done more human and environmental damage than he could have repaired in a second lifetime." It was not an auspicious beginning, but the transient youth found his home in the small libraries of towns such as Yuma, Kanab, Alamosa, Cardston, and Rock Springs. The books he read there, including John Wesley Powell's <i>Explorations of the Colorado River</i> and Mark Twain's <i>Roughing It</i>, helped him put his life into a native context; when he began to write, first articles and then books such as <i>Beyond the Hundredth Meridian</i> and <i>The Sound of Mountain Water</i>, he did so as a proud Westerner, disinclined to apologize to Eastern readers for living by choice in the Great American Outback. <p> Stegner lived long enough to see the transformation of the American West from a vast land punctuated by small farming and ranching towns to a place of huge cities driven by high technology and the military-industrial complex. He began to write about this transformation early on, and especially about areas where urban civilization encroached on undeveloped lands. His essay "Wilderness Letter" of 1962 has often been cited as an organizing document of the then-forming environmental movement, widely discussed in connection with such matters as the damming of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon and in Dinosaur National Monument; in it, Stegner alludes to wilderness as "a part of the geography of hope," a phrase that has become a byword of modern environmentalism. (Edward Abbey, who studied creative writing under Stegner at Stanford University, adopted it as a personal mantra.) "Wilderness Letter" and other of Stegner's writings for magazines such as the <i>New Yorker</i> and <i>Holiday</i>, many of them previously uncollected, are reprinted in this collection, which underscores the importance of Stegner's work to the development of Western regional literature and of contemporary ecological letters alike. <i>Marking the Sparrow's Fall</i>, edited by Stegner's son Page, makes for a fine introduction to Stegner's conservation works--other anthologies will have to address his contributions as a historian (e.g., <i>Mormon Country</i>) and as a novelist (e.g., <i>Angle of Repose</i>)--and it should help bring readers to the books in which Stegner elaborated environmental themes, such as <i>Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs</i> and <i>The American West As Living Space</i>. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>The author of Angle of Repose, Crossing to Safety, Where the Bluebird Sings to Lemonade Springs, and twenty-four other books, Wallace Stegner is a literary legend. He died in 1993. Page Stegner divides his time between northeastern Vermont and Truckee, California.</p><h2>Myths, Dreams, and Religion: Eleven Visions of Connection</h2><p>Myths, Dreams, and Religion.

But if chasing down bail jumpers, adulterous spouses, and workmen&#x2019;s comp cases seemed like the dregs of the PI game, it was at least a living. Not as much could be said for tracking down a man like Will &#x201c;the Ghost&#x201d; Stirman.<br><br>The stone-cold killer has just staged a bloody escape from the Floresville State Penitentiary with a gang of violent cons as spooked by Stirman as those on the outside who helped put him behind bars. And no one seems more worried than Navarre&#x2019;s boss and mentor, Erainya Manos. It was her husband along with rival PI Sam Barrera who built the case that sent Stirman away. But Erainya&#x2019;s husband is dead and she&#x2019;s certain Stirman won&#x2019;t let that stand in the way of his taking revenge against her and her adopted son.<br><br>All of Navarre&#x2019;s instincts are screaming that there&#x2019;s more to this case than meets the eye. But Erainya won&#x2019;t tell him&#x2014;and Sam Barrera seems to be escaping into a strange twilight from a truth too terrible to remember. That leaves Tres to dig into a twisted mystery of greed, vigilantism, and murder, where lives are bought and sold and the line between guilt and innocence is razor-thin. Meanwhile, Stirman and his gang are coming, leaving behind them a trail of brutal, unforgiving violence that will end in an area of San Antonio known as Southtown&#x2014;but that may soon just as well be called hell on earth.</p><p>Texas PI Tres Navarre, Riordan's series hero, is back in this gritty thriller about an escaped killer seeking revenge on everyone who put him away--including a detective's widow who just happens to be Navarre's partner. Will Stirman, the mastermind behind a human trafficking operation, was brought down by Fred Barrow and Sam Barrera, who killed his wife and stole his seven million dollars. Barrera is slipping into senility, and Barrow's death was a bad dream Erainya Barrow would just as soon forget. But now Stirman holds her life--and her young son's--in his hands, and he won't let go until he gets his revenge as well as his money. There's plenty of violence but not a lot of suspense in this solidly crafted but ultimately forgettable mystery. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Rick Riordan is the author of four previous Tres Navarre novels&#x2014;<b>Big Red Tequila</b>, winner of the Shamus and Anthony Awards; <b>The Widower&#x2019;s Two-Step</b>, winner of the Edgar Award; <b>The Last King of Texas</b>; and <b>The Devil Went Down to Austin</b>.

While her father was at the front fighting the Soviets, her mother moved the family around the country, ending up on a farm on the Arctic Circle, trying to keep her daughters safe from Russian bombs. Finland sued for peace with the Soviet Union in 1944, which made them enemies of the Germans, who had a standing army of 200,000 men in Finnish Lapland. War broke out with Germany, and the author&#39;s family managed in the nick of time to flee to Sweden. Throughout this historic drama are a tapestry of letters and family stories, along with the touching voice of the little girl Stina, whose observations, reflections, and worries move the reader along to the dramatic conclusion.</p><p></p><h2>Perhaps the Stars (Terra Ignota)</h2><p><p>The long years of near-utopia have come to an abrupt end. Peace and order are now figments of the past. Corruption, deception, and insurgency hum within the once steadfast leadership of the Hives, nations without fixed location. </p><p>The heartbreaking truth is that for decades, even centuries, the leaders of the great Hives bought the world's stability with a trickle of secret murders, mathematically planned. So that no faction could ever dominate. So that the balance held. The Hives' facade of solidity is the only hope they have for maintaining a semblance of order, for preventing the public from succumbing to the savagery and bloodlust of wars past. But as the great secret becomes more and more widely known, that facade is slipping away. Just days earlier, the world was a pinnacle of human civilization. Now everyone, Hives and hiveless, Utopians and sensayers, emperors and the downtrodden, warriors and saints scramble to prepare for the seemingly inevitable war. </p></p><p></p><h2>The Beheading (12) (The Beast Arises)</h2><p>Subterfuge and assassination bring this thrilling series to an end.<br><br>Despite the odds, the Imperium has triumphed. The orks have been defeated and the Great Beast is no more. Across the length and breadth of the galaxy, humankind celebrates its salvation, and relishes the prospect of a return of peace. But the war against the orks has riven the political bedrock of the Imperium, exposing its rotten core. One man, one powerful man, decides he has the solution, and launches a campaign of destruction so terrible that thousands of years later his actions will still be viewed with horror. And all the while, the true enemy watches and waits in the starless depths of space; an eternal evil that desires only to devour the souls of every living human soul in the galaxy.</p><p>Guy Haley is the author of the Space Marine Battles novel <i>Death of Integrity</i>, the Warhammer 40,000 novels <i>Valedor</i> and <i>Baneblade</i>, and The Beast Arises novel <i>Throneworld</i>.

The band, called the Avengers, was led by Abba Kovner, a charismatic young poet. In the ghetto, Abba had built bombs, sneaking out through the city's sewer tunnels to sabotage German outposts. Abba's chief lieutenants were two teenage girls, Vitka Kempner and Ruzka Korczak. At seventeen, Vitka and Ruzka were perhaps the most daring partisans in the East, the first to blow up a Nazi train in occupied Europe. Each night, the girls shared a bed with Abba, raising gossip in the ghetto. But what they found was more than temporary solace. It was a great love affair. After the liquidation of the ghetto, the Avengers escaped through the city's sewage tunnels to the forest, where they lived for more than a year in a dugout beside a swamp, fighting alongside other partisan groups, and ultimately bombing the city they loved, destroying Vilna's waterworks and its powerplant in order to pave the way for its liberation.<br><br>Leaving a devastated Poland behind them, they set off for the cities of Europe: Vitka and Abba to the West, where they would be instrumental in orchestrating the massive Jewish exodus to the biblical homeland, and Ruzka to Palestine, where she would be literally the first person to bring a first hand account of the Holocaust to Jewish leaders. It was in these last terrifying days--with travel in Europe still unsafe for Jews and the extent of the Holocaust still not widely known--that the Avengers hatched their plan for revenge. Before it was over, the group would have smuggled enough poison into Nuremberg to kill ten thousand Nazis. <b>The Avengers</b> is the story of what happened to these rebels in the ghetto and in the forest, and how, fighting for the State of Israel, they moved beyond the violence of the Holocaust and made new lives. <br><br>From Rich Cohen, one of the preeminent journalists of his generation and author of the highly praised <b>Tough Jews</b>, a powerful exploration of vindication and revenge, of dignity and rebellion, painstakingly recreated through his exclusive access to the Avengers themselves. Written with insight, sensitivity, and the moral force of one of the last great struggles of the Second World War, here is an unforgettable story for our time.</p><p>Rich Cohen, author of <i>Tough Jews</i>, has written what he calls "a Holocaust story without a concentration camp" about Jewish resistance fighters during World War II. <i>The Avengers: A Jewish War Story</i> describes how three young Jews--Cohen's cousin Ruzka Korczak, her friend Abba Kovner, and Kovner's future wife Vitka Klemperer--created an armed, underground movement behind the German lines in Poland with the goal of sabotaging the Nazis and helping the Russians advance. Cohen reports that Kovner described the group's dilemma this way: "If we act cowardly, we die; if we act courageously, we die. So we might as well act courageously." The group's fighting outlasted the war to exact revenge on the Nazis held in Nuremberg and finally to fight for Israel in the 1948 War for Independence. Researching <i>The Avengers</i>, Cohen spent time with the surviving resistance fighters in Israel and in Eastern Europe. The result is a deeply personal and impassioned defense of a movement that some readers will view with pride and others will condemn as vigilantism. This book, like <i>Tough Jews</i>, is a lively, intelligent, and heartfelt work of Jewish history. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"The story of the Jewish partisan fighters in World War II is not only fascinating, it is vital information for anyone trying to think about this nightmare century. Rich Cohen writes of the partisan Abba Kovner and his comrades with skill, passion, sensitivity, and great sustaining hope." <br>-- Ian Frazier<br><p>"A remarkable story by a remarkable writer. This is one of the great books about a period of time that never goes out of our consciousness. A terrific read. I love this book." <br>-- Larry King<br><br>"<b>The Avengers</b> tells a story that's never been told before, and tells it with a hallucinatory clarity. Rich Cohen has refuted forever Hannah Arendt's thesis that the Jews of Europe went quietly to their deaths. This is one of the most stirring books I have ever read."<br>-- James Atlas<br><br>"In period-perfect detail, Cohen portrays...the riveting story of the Avengers' escape from the ghetto, their acceptance of a renegade German officer who hated his army and their eventual emigration to Palestine. Cohen delivers a compelling story that not only amplifies the accepted version of Jewish experience in the Second World War, but also provides a terrific narrative of courage and tenacity."<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>The Martian</h2><p><p><b>Featured title on PBS's <i>The Great American Read</i> in 2018<br>Twentieth Century Fox&#x2019;s motion picture based on <i>The Martian</i> won 2 Golden Globe awards&#x2014;Best Director (Ridley Scott) and Best Actor (Matt Damon).<br>Winner of the 2015 Audie Award for Best Science Fiction</b></p><p>Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.

Perhaps it&#x2019;s the rugged terrain, beautiful scenery, or vast natural landscape that appeals to you. Or maybe you&#x2019;re just a lunatic who wants to survive in a lifeless barren wasteland. Whatever your reasons, there are a few things you should know:</p> <p><b>1: You&#x2019;re going to need a pressure vessel.</b></p> <p>Mars&#x2019;s atmospheric pressure is less than one percent of Earth&#x2019;s. So basically, it&#x2019;s nothing. Being on the surface of Mars is almost the same as being in deep space. You better bring a nice, sturdy container to hold air in. By the way, this will be your home forever. So try to make it as big as you can.</p> <p><b>2: You&#x2019;re going to need oxygen.</b></p> <p>You probably plan to breathe during your stay, so you&#x2019;ll need to have something in that pressure vessel. Fortunately, you can get this from Mars itself. The atmosphere is very thin, but it is present and it&#x2019;s almost entirely carbon dioxide. There are lots of ways to strip the carbon off carbon dioxide and liberate the oxygen. You could have complex mechanical oxygenators or you could just grow some plants. </p> <p><b>3: You&#x2019;re going to need radiation shielding. </b></p> <p>Earth&#x2019;s liquid core gives it a magnetic field that protects us from most of the nasty crap the sun pukes out at us. Mars has no such luxury. All kinds of solar radiation gets to the surface. Unless you&#x2019;re a fan of cancer, you&#x2019;re going to want your accommodations to be radiation-shielded. The easiest way to do that is to bury your base in Martian sand and rocks. They&#x2019;re not exactly in short supply, so you can just make the pile deeper and deeper until it&#x2019;s blocking enough. </p> <p><b>4: You&#x2019;re going to need water. </b></p> <p>Again, Mars provides. The Curiosity probe recently discovered that Martian soil has quite a lot of ice in it. About 35 liters per cubic meter. All you need to do is scoop it up, heat it, and strain out the water. Once you have a good supply, a simple distillery will allow you to reuse it over and over. </p> <p><b>5: You&#x2019;re going to need food. </b></p> <p>Just eat Martians. They taste like chicken. </p> <p><b>6: Oh, come on. </b></p> <p>All right, all right. Food is the one thing you need that can&#x2019;t be found in abundance on Mars. You&#x2019;ll have to grow it yourself. But you&#x2019;re in luck, because Mars is actually a decent place for a greenhouse. The day/night cycle is almost identical to Earth&#x2019;s, which Earth plants evolved to optimize for. And the total solar energy hitting the surface is enough for their needs. </p> <p>But you can&#x2019;t just grow plants on the freezing, near-vacuum surface. You&#x2019;ll need a pressure container for them as well. And that one might have to be pretty big. Just think of how much food you eat in a year and imagine how much space it takes to grow it. </p> <p>Hope you like potatoes. They&#x2019;re the best calorie yield per land area.</p> <p><b>7: You&#x2019;re going to need energy. </b></p> <p>However you set things up, it won&#x2019;t be a self-contained system. Among other things, you&#x2019;ll need to deal with heating your home and greenhouse. Mars&#x2019;s average daily temperature is -50C (-58F), so it&#x2019;ll be a continual energy drain to keep warm. Not to mention the other life support systems, most notably your oxygenator. And if you&#x2019;re thinking your greenhouse will keep the atmosphere in balance, think again. A biosphere is far too risky on this scale. </p> <p><b>8: You&#x2019;re going to need a reason to be there. </b></p> <p>Why go out of your way to risk your life? Do you want to study the planet itself? Start your own civilization? Exploit local resources for profit? Make a base with a big death ray so you can address the UN while wearing an ominous mask and demand ransom? Whatever your goal is, you better have it pretty well defined, and you better really mean it. Because in the end, Mars is a harsh, dangerous place and if something goes wrong you&#x2019;ll have no hope of rescue. Whatever your reason is, it better be worth it. </p>ANDY WEIR was first hired as a programmer for a national laboratory at age fifteen and has been working as a software engineer ever since.

The book aims to help students understand the processes, movements and individuals who have contributed to making the contemporary Christian landscape the shape it is in the 21st century. Theologically it takes a wide and inclusive approach to provide a balanced survey of Christianity in all its forms - Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox. Geographically it focuses on the Christian church in the UK, continental Europe and North America, and examines in each location the social movements, campaigns and campaigners, scientific and political challenges that have shaped the Christian Church throughout the period. <br><br>Beginning with the reaction to Lutherism, it charts the rise of Pietism in Europe throughout the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the influence of John Wesley and the Methodists, in the UK and the 'Great Awakening' in North America. The early chapters summarize the developments within the Christian Church in the UK, with detailed coverage of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish situations, throughout the 19th Century. This is followed by a summary of the various schools of thought to have developed through the 20th C, including the church's reaction to the 2 world wars in Europe, fundamentalism in the USA. The book also provides specific coverage of the religious situation in North America throughout the modern period covering the development of separate black churches, the 'New Evangelicalism'. <br><br>It is suitable for level two as well as introductory courses in modern church history or courses concerned with religion, culture and society in the 18th - 20th centuries</p><p>Tim Grass is a freelance writer and editor, and an Associate Tutor in Church History at Spurgeon&#39;s College.</p><h2>Print the Legend: The Life and Times of John Ford</h2><p>A definitive portrait of one of America&#39;s finest film directors follows the legendary John Ford through a career that spanned more than five decades, drawing on dozens of personal interviews, material from Ford&#39;s estate, and film criticism to present an authorized study of a film giant.</p><p>Borrowing his title from dialogue in John Ford's classic Western, <i>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i> ("When the legend becomes fact, print the legend"), Scott Eyman heeds this advice in his splendid study of Ford, finding a convincing balance between the gruff image Ford cultivated and the sensitive artist that Ford truly was. The result is a to-date definitive biography, occasionally prone to indelicate critical assessment while benefiting greatly from Eyman's full access to the Ford family archives. Arguably the greatest American filmmaker of the 20th century, Ford protected himself with a fa�ade of belligerence yet engendered more loyalty among his crew and stock players (notably John Wayne and Ward Bond) than any other director. Eyman illuminates the Ford legend while focusing on fact--on a complex genius who would berate even the most vulnerable actor and then "apologize without apologizing," a binge drinker who never let alcohol interfere with his closely-guarded artistry, and a stalwart Navy captain whose service in World War II became his primary source of pride.<p> <i>Print the Legend</i> essentially confirms Ford's brief affair with Katharine Hepburn, but Eyman emphasizes Ford's deep, abiding affection for his wife, Mary, who valiantly tolerated his absolute devotion to filmmaking. While hundreds of interviews yield a comprehensive account of Ford's working methods (which the director was loathe to discuss), Eyman expertly navigates around Ford's own penchant for autobiographical embellishment. What emerges is likely to remain the most thorough portrait of a cinematic master who recognized his own greatness without parading it, and whose human flaws were ultimately forgivable by those--and they were many--who loved him. Readers should look elsewhere for more astute studies of Ford's films, but Eyman has captured Ford the man with lasting authority. <i>-- Jeff Shannon</i></p><b>Scott Eyman</b> is books editor of <i>The Palm Beach Post</i> and author of seven previous books about film, including&nbsp;<i>Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer</i> and&nbsp;<i>Print the Legend: The Life and Times of John Ford.</i></p><h2>The Land of Laughs</h2><p>Schoolteacher Thomas Abbey travels into the enchanting supernatural when he begins the biography of his childhood idol, writer Marshall France, ironically aided by France&#39;s daughter Anna, who worshipped Abbey&#39;s own movie-star father</p><p>Thomas Abbey is a man stuck in a rut. An English teacher in a small Connecticut prep school, Abbey is in a crisis. His career is unfulfilling, he has no social or love life to speak of, and he cannot break out of the shadow of his famous father, the actor Stephen Abbey. To kick-start his life, he takes a sabbatical to work on a biography of his favorite writer, Marshall France. France's books were the only thing that kept Abbey sane during his childhood, and though he was renowned for his lyrical and imaginative children's books, nearly nothing was known about the writer's life.<p> Although Abbey has been warned that France's daughter Anna has blocked all previous attempts at her father's biography, he and Saxony Garder--an intense woman also obsessed with France's life--head to Galen, Missouri, with high hopes of breaking down Anna's resistance. They are surprised to find Anna the soul of small-town hospitality and quite excited about Abbey's proposal--even eager to get the project finished as soon as possible. Even stranger than Anna's behavior is the town of Galen itself. On the surface, all is as a small midwestern town should be. But the people of the town seem to know what their future holds--freak accidents and all--down to the hour and are as eager for Abbey to finish the biography as Anna is.</p><p> As far as plot goes, <i>The Land of Laughs</i> doesn't break any new ground--it is a riff on a very old literary theme--and the more interesting issues the story raises--fate, free will, and the creative power of the written word--receive only a glancing blow as the story careens to its somewhat unsatisfying Gothic ending. That said, Carroll does show a good ear for dialogue and a deft hand at creating complex characters and quietly ominous moods. And the story--hoary plot line and all--immediately grabs you and doesn't let go. If you already know Jonathan Carroll from his other novels, you will want to add this reissue of his first novel to your library. And if you haven't yet been introduced to this inventive author, <i>The Land of Laughs</i> is the perfect place to begin. <i>--Perry M.

We think of her reign (1558-1603) as a golden age of maritime heroes, like Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Richard Grenville and Sir Francis Drake, and of great writers, such as Edmund Spenser, Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare. But what was it actually like to live in Elizabethan England? If you could travel to the past and walk the streets of London in the 1590s, where would you stay? What would you eat? What would you wear? Would you really have a sense of it being a glorious age? And if so, how would that glory sit alongside the vagrants, diseases, violence, sexism and famine of the time? </p><p> </p><p> In this book Ian Mortimer answers the key questions that a prospective traveller to late sixteenth-century England would ask.

Children and adults will enjoy learning about the various systems of the body and their particular functions. Then they can get creative, coloring in the detailed illustrations of those systems.</p><p>Henry Gray&#39;s original Gray&#39;s Anatomy has remained a top anatomical resource for students over the past 100 years. It was published in England in 1858 and includes 1,247 detailed illustrations. Gray felt that the curriculum for medical information lacked comprehensive details of anatomical information (since medical books were usually small and pocket-sized at the time) thus his idea of creating a larger illustrated medical textbook.</p><h2>The New Spirit of Capitalism</h2><p>Why is the critique of capitalism so ineffective today? In this major work, the sociologists Eve Chiapello and Luc Boltanski suggest that we should be addressing the crisis of anticapitalist critique by exploring its very roots. <br><br>Via an unprecedented analysis of management texts which influenced the thinking of employers and contributed to reorganization of companies over the last decades, the authors trace the contours of a new spirit of capitalism. From the middle of the 1970s onwards, capitalism abandoned the hierarchical Fordist work structure and developed a new network-based form of organization which was founded on employee initiative and relative work autonomy, but at the cost of material and psychological security. <br><br>This new spirit of capitalism triumphed thanks to a remarkable recuperation of the &#x201c;artistic critique&#x201d;&#x2014;that which, after May 1968, attacked the alienation of everyday life by capitalism and bureaucracy. At the same time, the &#x201c;social critique&#x201d; was disarmed by the appearance of neocapitalism and remained fixated on the old schemas of hierarchical production. <br><br>This book, remarkable for its scope and ambition, seeks to lay the basis for a revival of these two complementary critiques.</p><p><b>Luc Boltanski</b> teaches sociology at the EHESS, Paris.

From black sharecroppers and subsistence farmers along the Mississippi River to contemporary life in the suburbs, the rituals of home and work link racial experience, social lines, and economic striving, rooting memory and scene in the southern landscape. Love and violence echo through the collection, and Feldman&#x2019;s beautifully crafted poems, often formal in style, answer them sometimes with an embrace and sometimes with a turning away. She witnesses the crop fields and manicured lawns, the dinner table and birthing room, the church and juke joint, conveying the ways that everyday details help build a life.<b></b>These evocative poems bring to life a rich and complex world, both timely and timeless.</p><p>Chanda Feldman grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. She holds degrees from Cornell University and the University of Chicago. She is a former Wallace Stegner Fellow in poetry at Stanford University and NEA poetry grant recipient and is currently a visiting assistant professor in creative writing at Oberlin College.These poems gather memory and lyric craft into a seamless mix of language and music. . . .Here is a house so bright at night it makes the rooster crow. Here is a quilt over a marriage bed. But here also are the poisons of race and record. . . .The weave of dailyness and history is remarkable, transferring these realities to the reader&#x2019;s present. These are wonderful, memorable poems. (Eavan Boland)<br><br>Chanda Feldman's quiet, powerful verse unfolds bloom after bloom with a slow seethe of Black-eyed Susans and leotards, of shadow land and grosgrain. Her family's color-lined lineage ripples through history and grown-folk talk. This poet's powers are subtle and slow-boiled as she takes us by the hand and leads us through season after season of challenge and change in a stumble-proof voice that never leaves a passenger behind. (Tyehimba Jess)<br><br>In a cadence reminiscent of old gospel rhythms rising from deeper reflections on the evolution of self and culture, the poet evokes her memories of family and history, sans sentimentalism. With heartfelt precision, Feldman builds the book to its shining summit, a testimony to getting through to an understanding of what it is to stand in awe of an awareness of how love persists. <i>Approaching the Fields</i> is a beautifully crafted book of courage gone, courage now taking breath, and courage yet to come. (Afaa M. Weaver)</p><h2>Molecular Red: Theory for the Anthropocene</h2><p>In <i>Molecular Red</i>, McKenzie Wark creates philosophical tools for the Anthropocene, our new planetary epoch, in which human and natural forces are so entwined that the future of one determines that of the other.<br><br> Wark explores the implications of Anthropocene through the story of two empires, the Soviet and then the American. The fall of the former prefigures that of the latter. From the ruins of these mighty histories, Wark salvages ideas to help us picture what kind of worlds collective labor might yet build. From the Russian revolution, Wark unearths the work of Alexander Bogdanov&#x2014;Lenin&#x2019;s rival&#x2014;as well as the great Proletkult writer and engineer Andrey Platonov.<br><br>The Soviet experiment emerges from the past as an allegory for the new organizational challenges of our time. From deep within the Californian military-entertainment complex, Wark retrieves Donna Haraway&#x2019;s cyborg critique and science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson&#x2019;s Martian utopia as powerful resources for rethinking and remaking the world that climate change has wrought. <i>Molecular Red</i> proposes an alternative realism, where hope is found in what remains and endures.</p><p><b>McKenzie Wark</b> is the author of<i> A Hacker Manifesto</i>, <i>Gamer Theory</i>, <i>The Beach Beneath the Street</i> and <i>The Spectacle of Disintegration</i>, among other books.

The book makes the case for a kind of political vision and action we need to recognize and enact. A true pleasure to read.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Kim Stanley Robinson, author of the Mars Trilogy</b><br><br> &#x201c;A very imaginative, historically smart, politically generative thesis ... that I think we urgently need.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Donna Haraway, author of <i>Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Molecular Red</i> seeks to put scholarship to work. The result is a playbook for the Anthropocene, a set of moves and strategies extracted from an unexpected canon of texts formed by a mash-up of the Soviet avant-garde and the Californian high-tech imaginary. Remnants of the two great empires of the twentieth century are pitted against the rapacious insurgency of their twenty-first-century progeny, playfully named by Wark as the Carbon Liberation Front.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Radical Philosophy</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A call to arms in which art and leisure, science and philosophy hack into each other in order to produce a way of thinking that works on both a pragmatic (proletarian) and a philosophical (bourgeois) level. It&#x2019;s also his own version of <i>Back to the Future</i>, in which Wark comes across as a bit of a Marty McFly, dashing back to the past to proclaim new heroes and new solutions to problems in the present&#x2014;principally climate change.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Art Review</i></b></p><h2>On Call In Hell: A Doctor&#39;s Iraq War Story</h2><p>A personal account of life on the frontlines of the war in Iraq chronicles the experiences of a thirty-eight-year-old Navy doctor during the Battle of Fallujah, when he and his medical team worked around the clock under fire to save the lives of troops involved in the horrific street fighting. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Cdr. Richard Jadick is the recipient of the Bronze Star with a Combat V for valor, the only Navy doctor to have been awarded one so far in the Iraq war. He is now a urology resident at the Medical College of Georgia and is still in the Navy.Lloyd James sounds like the character whose memories hes reading, the same age and with the voice one might expect from a young doctor--quiet but assertive. Capitalizing on the excitement of stories written by a surgeon in a war zone, the narration ceases to exist as well-painted mental images replace the words. Every once in a while James gives a little laugh or imitates a drill instructor, adding to but not upstaging the story. As battalion medical officer, while under heavy fire, Dr. Jadick helped his corpsmen staunch the bleeding when dozens of casualties surrounded them. His tales of life at war mingled with the agonies of familial estrangement could portray any GI in Iraq. J.A.H.

His last poem, Pale Fire, is put into a book, together with a preface, a lengthy commentary and notes by Shade&#39;s editor, Charles Kinbote. Known on campus as the &#39;Great Beaver&#39;, Kinbote is haughty, inquisitive, intolerant, but is he also mad, bad - and even dangerous? As his wildly eccentric annotations slide into the personal and the fantastical, Kinbote reveals perhaps more than he should. Nabokov&#39;s darkly witty, richly inventive masterwork is a suspenseful whodunit, a story of one-upmanship and dubious penmanship, and a glorious literary conundrum.</p><p>Like <i>Lolita</i>, Vladimir Nabokov's <i>Pale Fire</i> is a masterpiece that imprisons us inside the mazelike head of a mad �migr�. Yet <i>Pale Fire</i> is more outrageously hilarious, and its narrative convolutions make the earlier book seem as straightforward as a fairy tale. Here's the plot--listen carefully! John Shade is a homebody poet in New Wye, U.S.A. He writes a 999-line poem about his life, and what may lie beyond death. This novel (and seldom has the word seemed so woefully inadequate) consists of both that poem and an extensive commentary on it by the poet's crazy neighbor, Charles Kinbote.<p> According to this deranged annotator, he had urged Shade to write about his own homeland--the northern kingdom of Zembla. It soon becomes clear that this fabulous locale may well be a figment of Kinbote's colorfully cracked, prismatic imagination. Meanwhile, he manages to twist the poem into an account of Zembla's King Charles--whom he believes himself to <i>be</i>--and the monarch's eventual assassination by the revolutionary Jakob Gradus.</p><p> In the course of this dizzying narrative, shots are indeed fired. But it's Shade who takes the hit, enabling Kinbote to steal the dead poet's manuscript and set about annotating it. Is that perfectly clear? By now it should be obvious that <i>Pale Fire</i> is not only a whodunit but a who-wrote-it. There isn't, of course, a single solution. But Nabokov's best biographer, Brian Boyd, has come up with an ingenious suggestion: he argues that Shade is actually guiding Kinbote's mad hand from beyond the grave, nudging him into completing what he'd intended to be a 1,000-line poem. Read this magical, melancholic mystery and see if you agree. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In Pale Fire Nabokov offers a cornucopia of deceptive pleasures: a 999-line poem by the reclusive genius John Shade; an adoring foreword and commentary by Shade&#39;s self-styled Boswell, Dr. Charles Kinbote; a darkly comic novel of suspense, literary idolatry and one-upmanship, and political intrigue.</p><h2>A California Bestiary</h2><p>Inspired by medieval bestiaries, in which animals were presented in a fashion that favored the fanciful over the factual, Solnit and Caron have partnered to create their own book of magical beasts&#x2014;one in which the truth is stranger than fiction. Deeply aware of how much animal lore feeds the language of human imagination, Solnit uses her unique literary prowess to describe native California animals in such a way that they become as thrilling as any exotic creature of yore. From the bluebelly lizard and the California condor to the elephant seal and tule elk, this wondrous cast of characters reveal the depth of their magic. Enriched by Caron's illustrations, which keenly explore the play between human and animal realms, this collection will feed your dreams. This book was created in partnership with the Oakland Zoo, which has just unveiled plans to create an ambitious native California animal exhibit where local species will be rehabilitated and cared for.</p><p>Mona Caron grew up in the Swiss Italian Alps, among rivers, mosses, ferns, and lizards, where she dissected flowers instead of listening to lessons. She moved to San Francisco to study illustration and subsequently became one of the city's premier muralists.

The blade had slipped on the potato and cut a long gash into her wrist. There was blood everywhere. She looked at her blue veins, the red streak, the white sink, the yellow plastic colander where the peeled white potatoes lay glistening. Leaning against the sink, she began to cry. </p><p>I need to cry, Jos�phine thought. I don&#x2019;t know why. There are plenty of reasons, and this one is as good as any. She grabbed a dishcloth and pressed it on the cut. I&#x2019;m going to turn into a fountain of tears, a fountain of blood, a fountain of sighs. I&#x2019;m going to let myself die. </p><p>That was one solution. Just die, without a word. Fade away, like a lamp slowly dimming. </p><p>I&#x2019;ll die standing here at the sink, she thought, then corrected herself. No one dies standing up. You die lying down, or with your head in the oven, or in the bathtub. She&#x2019;d read in some newspaper that the most common form of suicide for women was jumping out the window. For men it was hanging. Jump out the window? </p><p>She could never do that. But to weep as she bled to death, unable to tell whether the liquid streaming out of her was red or white? To fall slowly asleep . . . </p><p>Jos�phine took a deep breath, adjusted the dish towel on her wrist, choked back her tears, and stared at her reflection in the window. </p><p>Get on with it, she told herself, peel those potatoes. You can think about all that other stuff later. </p><p>It was a late May morning, and the thermometer read 82 degrees in the shade. Out on their fifth-floor balcony, Jos�phine&#x2019;s husband was playing chess against himself. Antoine worked hard to make it realistic, switching sides and picking up his pipe as he went. He hunched over the chessboard, blew out some smoke, lifted a piece, sucked on the pipe, put the piece back, exhaled again, picked up the piece again and moved it, shaking his head as he put the pipe down and went to sit in the other chair. </p><p>He was of average height, with brown hair and eyes. The crease of his trousers was razor sharp, and his shoes looked as if they had just come out of the box. His rolled-up shirtsleeves revealed slim forearms and wrists, and his nails had the luster of a professional manicure. He looked nicely groomed, the type of man you&#x2019;d put in a furniture catalog to inspire confidence in the merchandise&#x2019;s quality. </p><p>Suddenly Antoine moved a piece, and a smile lit up his face. </p><p>&#x201c;Checkmate!&#x201d; he announced to his imaginary partner. &#x201c;Poor guy, you&#x2019;re screwed. Never saw it coming!&#x201d; </p><p>He got up, stretched, and decided to make himself a little drink, even though it wasn&#x2019;t quite that time yet. </p><p>He usually had a cocktail around six, while watching his fa�vorite TV quiz show, Questions pour un champion. It had become a daily ritual, and he looked forward to it. Missing the show put him in a foul mood. Every evening he would tell himself that he should try out for the show himself, but things never went any further than that. He knew that he&#x2019;d have to get past the elimi�nation rounds, and something about the words elimination rounds chagrined him. He lifted the lid of the ice bucket, care�fully dropped a couple of cubes into a glass, and poured himself a Martini Bianco. </p><p>Antoine followed the exact same routine every day. Up with the kids at seven, breakfast of whole-wheat toast, apricot jam with salted butter, and freshly squeezed orange juice. Next came a thirty-minute workout: back, stomach, abs, quads. Then the newspapers, which his daughters took turns bringing him before they left for school. This was followed by a careful perusal of the help-wanted ads and mailing his r�sum� when he saw something interesting. Then a shower and shave, selecting his clothes for the day, and finally, a game of chess. </p><p>Choosing what to wear was his morning&#x2019;s most challenging moment. He had lost a sense of how to dress. Relaxed weekend style, or a suit and tie? One day he had thrown on some sweat�pants, and his older daughter wasn&#x2019;t pleased when he picked her up at school. </p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you working, Dad?&#x201d; asked Hortense. &#x201c;Are you still on vacation? I like it when you&#x2019;re all handsome in an elegant jacket, a nice shirt and tie. Don&#x2019;t ever pick me up from school in sweats again, okay?&#x201d; Seeing Antoine&#x2019;s face fall, she softened her tone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m saying this for your own good, so you&#x2019;ll always be the world&#x2019;s most handsome dad.&#x201d; </p><p>Hortense was right. People looked at him differently when he was well dressed. </p><p>The game of chess over, Antoine watered the plants along the edge of the balcony, picked off dead leaves, pruned the older branches, spritzed the new buds with water, turned the soil with a spoon, and added fertilizer. He was quite concerned about the white camellia. He spoke to it, took extra time caring for it, lov�ingly wiping each leaf. </p><p>It had been the same thing every morning for the past year. On this particular morning, however, he&#x2019;d fallen behind schedule. The chess game had been unusually tough, and he had to be careful not to lose track of time. </p><p>&#x201c;Watch it, Tonio, don&#x2019;t let yourself go,&#x201d; he said aloud. &#x201c;Get your act together.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d gotten used to talking to himself, and he frowned at the self-admonition. He decided to let the plants go for the day. </p><p>He passed the kitchen where Jos�phine was peeling potatoes. Seeing her from behind, he again noted that she was putting on weight. When they first moved to this suburban apartment building just outside Paris, she was tall and slim. Their daughters were so little, barely reached the edge of the sink. Those were the days. He would lift up her sweater, put his hands on her breasts, and whisper things in her ear until she gave in. Jo would bend down over the bed, smoothing the bedspread all the while so it wouldn&#x2019;t get rumpled. </p><p>Sundays, she would cook. Pots would be steaming on the stove, dishcloths drying on the oven door handle. Chocolate for a mousse would be melting in a double boiler. The kids shelled nuts or gave themselves mustaches with chocolate-covered fingers, then licked them off with the tips of their tongues. </p><p>Tenderly, Antoine and Jos�phine had watched the girls grow up. Every couple of months they would measure them, penciling their heights on the wall, which was soon laddered with little lines followed by dates and the girls&#x2019; names, Hortense and Zo�. </p><p>Every time Antoine leaned against the kitchen door frame, he felt overwhelmed by sadness and loss, remembering a time when life had seemed to smile on him. This never happened in the bedroom or the living room; always in the kitchen, which had once held all his joy. </p><p>A book by the medievalist Georges Duby lay open on the kitchen table. Antoine bent down to read the title: The Knight, the Lady, and the Priest. Jos�phine had been working in the kitchen. What used to be a hobby was now paying the bills. She was a historian specializing in twelfth-century women at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the famed CNRS. Antoine used to make fun of her work, saying, with a laugh, &#x201c;My wife is passionate about history, but only the twelfth century.&#x201d; Now the twelfth century was putting food on the table. </p><p>Antoine cleared his throat to attract Jos�phine&#x2019;s attention. Her hair was piled on top of her head, held in place with a pencil. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going for a walk,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>&#x201c;Are you coming back for lunch?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Don&#x2019;t wait for me.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me earlier?&#x201d; </p><p>Antoine hated confrontation. He probably should have simply left, shouting, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going out, be back in a bit.&#x201d; That would have been all. He&#x2019;d be in the stairway and she&#x2019;d be in the kitchen with her questions stuck in her throat. He&#x2019;d find some excuse when he came back. Because he always came back. </p><p>&#x201c;Did you read the help-wanted ads?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Nothing interesting today.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s always work for someone who wants to work.&#x201d; </p><p>Work, sure, but I&#x2019;m not about to take just any old job, he thought. </p><p>&#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re going to say, Jo.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You know it, but you don&#x2019;t do a thing to make it happen. You could take whatever job you can, to help make ends meet.&#x201d; </p><p>He could have continued the conversation on his own. He knew it by heart: lifeguard, groundskeeper at a tennis club, night watchman, gas station attendant. But all he could think was that the phrase &#x201c;making ends meet&#x201d; had a funny ring. </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, smile!&#x201d; she spat, glaring at him. &#x201c;I must sound like a broken record, always talking about money. Monsieur doesn&#x2019;t want to tire himself out for just any old job. Monsieur wants respect! And right now, all monsieur wants to do is run off to his manicurist!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What are you talking about, Jos�phine?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You know exactly what I&#x2019;m talking about!&#x201d; </p><p>Now Jos�phine was facing him, shoulders back, the dishcloth around her wrist. She was daring him. </p><p>&#x201c;If you mean Myl�ne . . .&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I mean Myl�ne.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Jo, stop! This is going to end badly.&#x201d; </p><p>Who could have told her? They didn&#x2019;t know many people in the building, but when there&#x2019;s gossip to be had, friends appear out of nowhere. Someone must have seen him going into Myl�ne&#x2019;s place, two streets away. </p><p>Jos�phine was still facing him. </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have lunch together. She&#x2019;ll have made you a quiche and a green salad&#x2014;a light meal because, afterward, she at least has to go back to work.&#x201d; Jos�phine ground her teeth as she said &#x201c;she.&#x201d; &#x201c;Then you&#x2019;ll have a little nap. She&#x2019;ll draw the curtains, take off her clothes, and drop them on the floor. Then she&#x2019;ll climb under the white cotton lace bedspread with you.&#x201d; </p><p>Antonio listened to her in shock. Myl�ne did have a white lace bedspread. How could Jos�phine know that? </p><p>&#x201c;Have you been to her apartment?&#x201d; </p><p>Jos�phine laughed harshly and tightened the dishcloth with her free hand. &#x201c;So I was right. White lace goes with everything!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Jo, stop it!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Stop what?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Stop imagining things that aren&#x2019;t true.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Are you saying she doesn&#x2019;t have a lace bedspread?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You really should be writing novels. You&#x2019;ve got the imagi�nation for it.&#x201d; </p><p>He was suddenly furious. He couldn&#x2019;t stand his wife anymore. He couldn&#x2019;t stand her schoolmarm tone, her slouch, her shapeless, colorless clothes, her bad skin, her limp brown hair. Everything about her reeked of effort and thrift. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m leaving before this conversation gets out of hand.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;So you are going to see her? At least have the courage to tell the truth, since you don&#x2019;t have enough balls to look for work, you lazy bastard!&#x201d; </p><p>That last word did it. He felt anger pounding at his temples. He spit out his words so that he wouldn&#x2019;t have to take them back: </p><p>&#x201c;Okay, fine! I meet her at her place every day at twelve thirty. She heats up a pizza and we eat it in her bed under the white lace bedspread. After brushing away the crumbs, I take off her bra, which is also white lace, and I kiss her all over. Happy now? I warned you not to push me.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;If you go to her now, don&#x2019;t bother coming back. Pack your bags. It&#x2019;ll be no great loss.&#x201d; </p><p>He stumbled to their bedroom like a sleepwalker. He pulled a big suitcase out from under the bed, lifted it onto the quilt, and piled his T-shirts, socks, and underwear in it. The red wheeled suitcase was from his days at Gunman &amp; Co., the American hunting gun manufacturer. He had been their director of Eu�ropean sales for ten years, taking wealthy clients on hunting trips to Africa, Asia, and South America to the bush, the savannah, or the pampas. In those days he was the white man with the year-round tan who had drinks with his clients, some of the wealthiest people on earth. That was when he started calling himself Tonio. Tonio Cort�s. It was more masculine, more accomplished-sounding, than Antoine. He had to be those men&#x2019;s equal. He was proud of being able to hang out with these people without really being one of them. </p><p>He earned a big salary and got a generous year-end bonus, a good retirement plan, and plenty of vacation days. He used to love coming home to Courbevoie. His apartment building had been built in the 1990s for young professionals like himself who couldn&#x2019;t yet afford to live in Paris proper. They lurked just on the other side of the Seine, waiting for their chance to move to the elegant neighborhoods of the capital whose lights they could see at night, glittering like a neon birthday cake. </p><p>Antoine never said when he was coming back from a trip. He would just push open the front door and wait a second in the entry before whistling briefly to announce his arrival. Jos�phine was always absorbed in her books. The two little girls would be in their bathrobes, one in pink, the other in blue. Hortense, the pretty, sassy one, had him wrapped around her little finger. And then there was soft, chubby Zo�, who loved to eat. He&#x2019;d sweep them up in his arms, repeating, &#x201c;My darlings, my little darlings.&#x201d; That was the ritual. Sometimes he&#x2019;d feel a pang of guilt, recalling the sex he&#x2019;d had just the night before. Antoine would hug them all the tighter, and the images of the other women faded. Then he&#x2019;d launch into his hero act. He made up stories about hunting expeditions, including one about a wounded lion he finished off with a knife, an antelope he caught with a lasso, and a crocodile he knocked unconscious. </p><p>Then a year ago Gunman &amp; Co. was bought out, and he was fired. That&#x2019;s the way it is with Americans, he explained to Jos�phine. One day you&#x2019;re the head of sales with a three-window office, the next you&#x2019;re filing for unemployment. For a while, his generous severance package allowed him to keep up the house payments, pay for school fees, language-immersion trips, the upkeep of the car, and ski vacations. Antoine had been philosophical about it all. He was fine. He wasn&#x2019;t the first person this had happened to, and he wasn&#x2019;t just anybody: he would soon find work. </p><p>But after going through his savings, he felt his self-confidence wavering. Especially at night. He would wake at three in the morning, quietly get up, pour himself a whiskey in the living room, and turn on the TV. In the past, he had always felt very strong and insightful. When he first heard about the buyout and possible layoffs, he told himself that his ten years at Gunman &amp; Co. would certainly count for something. He was the first person to be laid off. </p><p>Antoine sat on the bed and stared at the tips of his shoes. Looking for work was so depressing. He was just another number on a form. He...</p></p><h2>The Cyanide Canary</h2><p>Recounts the story of young Scott Dominquez, a promising former high school wrestler who was left brain damaged by the environmental malpractices of his employer, documenting the efforts of an EPA investigator to bring the employer to justice. 35,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Joseph Hilldorfer</b> is a Special Agent for the Environmental Protection Agency and a member of the National Counter-Terrorism Evidence Response Team. He has been involved in high-profile environmental investigations in the Pacific Northwest since 1992. Prior to joining EPA, Hilldorfer was a distinguished Special Agent with the FBI in Seattle and New York City, working high-profile cases such as the Green River Killer and going undercover for the Counter-Espionage Squad. With an M.A. in Criminal Justice Administration from Indiana University of Pennsylvania and a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, he is admitted to the Pennsylvania bar. He lives in Seattle, Washington.<br><br><b>Robert Dugoni</b> has practiced as a civil litigator in San Francisco and Seattle for seventeen years. In 1999 he left the full-time practice of law to write, and is a two-time winner of the Pacific Northwest Writers Association Literary Contest. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford University with a degree in journalism and worked as a reporter for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> before obtaining his doctorate of jurisprudence from the University of California at Los Angeles School of Law. He lives with his wife and two children in the Pacific Northwest.*Starred Review* At the core of this enthralling legal drama is a 250-gallon storage tank containing cyanide. On August 26, 1996, a 20-year-old worker at a fertilizer plant in Soda Springs, Idaho, was ordered to clean the tank, which he and other workers believed contained only dirt and water. The worker, who was told he needed no safety equipment for the job, was overcome by fumes and emerged severely brain damaged. Hilldorfer, an environmental-crime specialist for the EPA, and writer Dugoni retrace the EPA's effort to uncover what led to the accident and to bring the responsible parties to justice. Before Hilldorfer's campaign, environmental crimes were largely ignored or, when brought to trial, resulted only in pro-forma wrist slaps. This account engages the reader, evoking both outrage over worker safety and suspense over the outcome of the trial. The authors combine accounts of Hilldorfer's own experiences (he appears as a character in the book) with interviews, sworn trial testimony, court transcripts, and newspaper articles to tell a fully rounded, gripping story of how environmental crime is prosecuted in the real world. The title of the book is especially apt: it refers both to the old miners' practice of bringing canaries into mines as early warning systems of poisonous gases and to the fate of the brain-damaged worker, whose plight may yet save others. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But while the police fumble to find clues, Miss Marple begins to ask her own questions, because as she knows&#x2014;even the most peaceful village can hide dark secrets.</p>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became, quite simply, the best-selling novelist in history. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign languages. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.</p><h2>That boy Emil!</h2><p>That boy Emil from L�nneberga, he got up to mischief almost every day.

Halprin's creativity, as his <i>notebooks</i> attest, springs from his synthesizing instincts: the joining of elements of landscape and cityscape, melding of individual architectural entities with community living patterns. The whole is enlivened by Halprin's awareness in such matters as group and ecological dynamics, participatory art, the choreography and scoring of human movement.<br> <br> The notebooks reveal an embracing of progressively more inclusive environments over the years: "In the early notebooks there is emphasis on gardens and on landscape...the latter notebooks reflect my increasing interest and commitment to the total environment as an integrating matrix for 'community.'" The reader will find here both an abiding interest in the natural environment and an evolving interest in the man-made environment. There are numerous drawings of mountains, rock formations, and waterfalls in California and elsewhere and an increasing concern with cities and how they can best serve man and nature. Halprin records his reactions to a worldwide array of cities&#x2014;Paris, Venice, Los Angeles, Jerusalem&#x2014;and displays drawings of their grand aspects and sketches of their intimate features.<br> <br> Other entries reflect the inception and growth process of ideas later to be fully realized in book form <i>(Cities; Freeways; New York New York; The RSVP Cycles)</i> or in built form (the Portland fountains). Still others relate to Halprin's recent involvement with community workshops, group sessions and participatory planning. In short, the full range of Halprin's imagination and professional activities is displayed here: "These notebooks have been&#x2014;for me&#x2014;a process...a way of exploring ideas and of 'scoring' the future...they are filled with the trying-out-of-things...of alternative score <i>S</i> which have then been either discarded or recycled into actuality or put aside for other times...they are full of letters either sent or not sent, articles published or never submitted for publication, speeches made or only imagined...an assemblage."<br> <br> The material in this book represents about one-twelfth of the original notebooks and was selected by an associate, Jim Burns, on the grounds that someone close to Halprin's work but at one removed from his total personal involvement could best present a cross section equally accenting past interests and current concerns. The notebook is entirely written in Halprin's very legible hand.</p><p></p><h2>El Laberinto De LA Soledad / The Labyrinth of Solitude (Letras Hispanicas) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Octavio Paz has written one of the most enduring and powerful works ever created on Mexico and its people, character, and culture.

"Abzug was certainly a major player in our change in attitudes in the second part of the past century [and] Suzanne Braun Levine and Mary Thom give us a fascinating glimpse into [an] inspirational but undeniably peculiar period that is receding, all too quickly, into the past." <b>Carolyn See, <i>The Washington Post </i></b> "A fabulous read about a breed of politician now largely extinct . . . Levine and Thom have crafted a history that brings to life one of the great political personalities of the twentieth century." <b>Alice Echols, <i>Bookforum </i></b>&nbsp;"Abzug was certainly a major player in our change in attitudes in the second part of the past century [and] Suzanne Braun Levine and Mary Thom give us a fascinating glimpse into [an] inspirational but undeniably peculiar period that is receding, all too quickly, into the past." <b>Carolyn See, <i>The Washington Post </i></b>&nbsp;"[A] fluid, sharply edited book . . . Abzug was a force of nature, and the stories about her are consistently feisty." <b>Jon Dolan, <i>Time Out New York</i></b> &nbsp;"During this 'historic' election year, let me just say what so many of us are thinking: I miss Bella Abzug. And Barbara Jordan. What I would give to see Bella toss one of her signature striped, oversized hats into the presidential ring. Or to hear Barbara Jordan debate an comer, to hear her intone the preamble of the constitution as she reminds us of the true meanings of 'equality' and 'justice.' If only big, bold Bella or big, bold Barbara were here to run . . . and win. So far my only solace has been the recently published oral history of Bella . . . The book is edited by Suzanne Braun Levine and Mary Thom, women with long histories of activism and scholarship in and about the women&#x2019;s movement in America." <b>Susan Davis,<i>The News &amp; Observer</i> (Raleigh)</b> &nbsp;"This is like being a fly on the wall for some of the most important moments in political history over the past fifty years. Being a part of this conversation makes you not just appreciate Bella's fierceness, but want to emulate it." <b>Amy Richards,&nbsp;co-author of <i>Manifesta</i>&nbsp;and former colleague of Bella<br><br></b>"Bella was a radical,&nbsp;patriotic and passionate about transforming the system with the courage to work from outside and the patience to work from inside. Like her life, this book radiates drama, humor, tactical brilliance and heart. Bella mattered. So does this book." <b>Jane Fonda</b><b><br><br></b>"Stumped about what to do in this messed up world? Just get to know Bella Abzug, one of the most important activists of the twentieth century. By gathering the reminiscences of people who lived their personal and political lives right along with her and sometimes had the courage to break the rules alongside her too the authors have created a memoir in many voices that captures the suspense, humor, and contradictions of this great woman. Read this book and then ask yourself, <i>What would Bella do?</i>" <b>Gloria Steinem<br><br></b>"Bella Abzug didn't vet her opinions through consultants and polls. She wasn't a highly orchestrated pre-fab candidate sprung from a well-oiled multi-million dollar corporate machine. She was the real deal. Pro-peace, pro-worker, pro-women. Angry, authentic, grassroots, alienating and alive. And, she actually got elected. This book is a call to all of us, but particularly those in government to run and lead through their own moral steam rather than blowing more hot air." <b>Eve Ensler<br><br></b>"<i>Bella Abzug</i> is an important, inspiring piece of history. There's nothing we need more right now than this kind of cogent reminder of what it takes to make change in the halls of power and what's at stake if we don't." <b>Lisa Jervis, co-founder of <i>Bitch</i> magazine</b></p><p><b>Suzanne Braun Levine and Mary Thom</b> are both nationally recognized authorities on women&#x2019;s issues.

The speakers evoked a heady era of political possibility as they told Bella stories&#x201d;; they implored each other to preserve her legacy and carry forward her agenda. They began asking each other, as colleagues and admirers still do today, nearly a decade later, What would Bella do?<br>One of the first speakers was Geraldine Ferraro, the only woman to appear on a major party presidential ticket, as Walter Mondale&#x2019;s running mate in 1984. If there had never been a Bella Abzug, there would never have been a Gerry Ferraro,&#x201d; she said. Bella didn&#x2019;t knock lightly on the door. She didn&#x2019;t even push it open or batter it down. She took it off the hinges forever. So that those of us who came after could walk through.&#x201d; Marlo Thomas told how happy Bella was to hear that she was finally getting married and then began to push her to have children. I said, Bella, I got married. Make Gloria [Steinem] have the babies!&#x2019; &#x201d; Marlo&#x2019;s husband, Phil Donahue, recalled a gathering of intellectual luminaries at which he sat next to Bella. Minutes into each presentation, she would mumble, Good. Sit down.&#x201d; The historian Amy Swerdlow marveled at Bella&#x2019;s brilliance as a strategist&#x201d; and recalled her appearance impersonating Marlene Dietrich, dressed in a tuxedo and singing Falling in Love Again.&#x201d; Jane Fonda wore a hat to commemorate Bella&#x2019;s signature symbol. Shirley MacLaine true to her faith in channeling spoke directly&#x201d; to Bella, and the microphone mysteriously jumped to one side. Speakers recalled the pride she took in her two daughters and the great love affair&#x201d; with Martin, her husband of more than four decades, who had died twelve years earlier.<br>Gloria Steinem, one of the last speakers, tried to sum up this larger-than-life, braver-than-any leader. She described how frightened she was the first time she encountered Bella&#x2019;s outsized voice and aggressive conviction. Then she took note of Bella&#x2019;s independence and unremitting passion and pointed out that she had come up through social justice movements, not through a political party.&#x201d; In other words, she was beholden to no institution with traditions, trade-offs, and party lines; she was guided by her commitment to the ideas and the groups she believed were working to make society more responsive to the needs of the people.<br>As a lawyer and a congresswoman, Bella Abzug was an activist and leader in every major social movement of her lifetime from socialist Zionism and labor in the forties, to the civil rights, ban-the-bomb, and anti Vietnam war movements in the fifties and sixties; the women&#x2019;s movement in the seventies and eighties; and, in the years before she died, global human rights, as, along with her lifelong collaborator, Mim Kelber, she founded the Women&#x2019;s Environment and Development Organization to promote an international agenda of economic equality and environmental sanity.<br>She began her life&#x2019;s work as an advocate and organizer, developing policy and legal arguments, making connections between ideas and constituencies. Then in 1970, at age fifty, she ran for office for the first time and was elected to Congress, representing a progressive district in Manhattan. Being on the inside was a new experience for her, but Bella became one of the most respected strategists in the Congress. Friend and foe alike marveled at her mastery of congressional procedure and her innovative approaches to legislation. Moreover, she continued mobilizing pressure on the government, organizing women around the country to participate in lobbying her colleagues, and securing funding and authorization for the First National Women&#x2019;s Conference, which she chaired after she left office. Then she was appointed chair of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Women only to find herself on the outside again, when President Jimmy Carter fired her for the insubordination of insisting that the economy and even foreign policy were women&#x2019;s issues.<br>With each evolution her career underwent, her core commitment to social justice took on a new dimension. Thus, for Bella, feminism was a natural extension of her years in progressive politics; for many other women, the politics came later, growing out of the frustrating experience of trying to establish an equal footing in the culture. From the beginning she was committed to diversifying and enlarging the reach of any movement she became part of.<br>No matter how big the job she took on, Bella always made it bigger. As a member of Congress from New York, she became better known in most other districts than the representative serving there. Later, as an international leader and activist, she may have been better known in several other countries than in her own. To this day, women leaders in emerging countries will identify themselves as the Bella Abzug of Nigeria&#x201d; or the Bella Abzug of Mongolia.&#x201d;<br>Along the way, she ruffled plenty of feathers. But she stood up to all adversaries with fierce conviction, and frequently bested them with her trademark wit. In 1995, at seventy-five and in a wheelchair, she was attending the world conference on women in Beijing, when George H. W. Bush, who was in China on a private visit to give a speech to corporate executives, attacked her as an extremist. I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella running around,&#x201d; he said. Bella&#x2019;s reply left no doubt as to what she thought of that remark: He was addressing a fertilizer group? That&#x2019;s appropriate.&#x201d;<br>For over half a century, Bella Abzug was the standard-bearer for the politics of the powerless and disenfranchised. While others courted interest groups, she gathered her constituencies into a larger and larger coalition. Where did she get the chutzpah? Where did she get the resilience and optimism and tenacity? Where did she get the brilliance?<br>Most perplexing, where are the contemporary voices of outrage and defiant optimism? In recent years the executive branch of government has reconfigured the relationship of the United States with the rest of the world from trusted alliances to unilateral exercise of power, with barely a murmur from our elected representatives. Until recently, momentous issues were being decided virtually without public debate or accountability from Congress. In the lead-up to the 2008 elections, it is inconceivable that Bella would keep quiet. Even if she couldn&#x2019;t immediately change minds, she would raise the issues and her voice. She would prod and poke; haggle and debate; educate and galvanize. If she were still among us, what would Bella do? If we are to carry forward her legacy, what should we do?<br>The question is repeated over and over again in conversations with those who knew her personally and worked with her. It is echoed by those who only know of her and long for a resurgence of the kind of fierce outrage and creative stubbornness she stood for. Bella&#x2019;s real legacy may turn out to be the inspiration her life offers us and the model she sets for the kind of leadership we are so desperately looking for today.<br>Because we both knew and worked with her, we know how uppity and vivid she was, how passionate and loud. We were convinced that the way to bring her persona to life was to build a memoir in many voices from her own testimony and the words of those who knew her. The stories told by fellow politicians, family, friends, and enemies evoke one of the most colorful, controversial, effective, courageous and very cantankerous women of the twentieth century. The image that emerges has many layers. Her complex relationships with family, friends, and colleagues could generate deep conflict and bitterness as well as joy and appreciation.<br>No one is able to talk about Bella without reciting a Bella story,&#x201d; frequently assuming her unmistakable New York accent in the telling. (Norman Mailer, not an admirer, said her voice could boil the fat off a taxicab driver&#x2019;s neck.&#x201d;) Everyone had a favorite Bella phrase that nailed an issue. The journalist Myra MacPherson singled out a favorite with typical Bella vocabulary: Abzug even stressed equality for the mediocre, cracking that the goal was not to see a female Einstein become an assistant professor. We want a woman schlemiel to get promoted as quickly as a male schlemiel.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>We assembled a list of people to interview, from those who knew her as a girl growing up in the Bronx through those who were beside her in the historic moments she helped create as well as those who worked for her (now that was an experience). We also had access to her incomplete memoir and to oral histories taken at Columbia University. In addition to evoking one of the most audacious and outrageous women of her time, the testimony brings to life many compelling people who shared moments in her political legacy.<br>We edited those interviews into a conversation&#x201d; in which the story unfolds through anecdote, embellishment, contradiction, flashback and flash-forward, asides, commentary, speculation as if the wide-ranging and ill-assorted cast of characters were gathered around a fireplace reminiscing about someone who stomped into their lives and left an indelible mark. It is not necessary to know who&#x2019;s who to follow the plot, but we have also provided thumbnail sketches of all the speakers. To set the stage, each chapter begins with a short chronology of events in Bella&#x2019;s life and the world at large.<br>The cumulative testimony speaks to a particular...</p><h2>Murder Most Persuasive: A Mystery (Elizabeth Parker Mysteries)</h2><p><p><i>Finalist for the Mary Higgins Clark Award</i><br><i><br></i><i></i><br><i><br></i>After the death of Elizabeth Parker's great-uncle Martin Reynolds, the family's house in the picturesque Maryland town of St. Michaels is sold.

No one, that is, except his wife, Bonnie. It was the final and most telling example of the total lack of communication that existed in their marriage. The fact that the cancer he&#x2019;d battled for years proved more than his weakened seventy-seven-year-old body could handle somehow managed to escape Bonnie entirely. But to be fair, most things escaped Bonnie entirely.<br>&#x201c;My poor, poor Marty!&#x201d; Bonnie now murmured with a mournful shake of her blond head. &#x201c;How could this have happened?&#x201d; No one responded. The funeral services had been held at ten in the morning, after which the family had escorted Martin&#x2019;s remains to Arlington Cemetery where, as a former naval officer, he was granted a burial spot. It was now one in the afternoon. By my modest count, Bonnie had uttered this same question some eighty-seven times since the day began. After about the sixty-fifth utterance, most of the family had stopped trying to console her, as our words of sympathy fell on deaf ears. By the seventy-second time, even the nicest among us had fallen silent. Now, unfortunately, her rhetorical murmurings were prompting unabashed eye rolling from the more callous attendees.<br>&#x201c;Stop that!&#x201d; I hissed at my aunt Winnie, whose orbs now seemed in danger of disappearing completely into her skull.<br>&#x201c;Oh, please,&#x201d; she retorted with a toss of her head. The small movement sent her bright red curls quivering. &#x201c;This is nothing more than standard Bonnie drama.&#x201d;<br>She was right, of course, and as Martin&#x2019;s younger sister, Aunt Winnie had had a front-row seat for several of Bonnie&#x2019;s performances over the years. &#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; Aunt Winnie continued, &#x201c;you know how I hate artifice of any kind.&#x201d;<br>I rolled my own eyes at this and glanced meaningfully at Aunt Winnie&#x2019;s trademark curls, which, if anything, had only grown redder during her seventy-odd years. Curving her equally red lips into a warning smile, Aunt Winnie murmured, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a smart-ass, Elizabeth.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Me? Perish the thought. I didn&#x2019;t say a word.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. But you were thinking it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Careful,&#x201d; she said meaningfully, &#x201c;or I&#x2019;ll tell your mother.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tell her what?&#x201d; I inquired after a moment&#x2019;s pause.<br>Aunt Winnie opened her green eyes very wide and leaned in close. &#x201c;Do you really need me to catalog all the dirt I have on you?&#x201d; she asked good-naturedly.<br>Aunt Winnie is my great-aunt on my mother&#x2019;s side. More important, she has been my confidante ever since I was twelve years old and she bagged me trying to stuff my pathetically empty bra with toilet paper. I&#x2019;m now twenty-eight. While I no longer stuff my bra&#x2014;more due to a resignation to certain facts than because of any major developments in that area&#x2014;Aunt Winnie still has enough dirt on me to start a landfill. I sat back in my chair, an exaggeratedly polite expression on my face. &#x201c;Blackmailer,&#x201d; I hissed.<br>She gave a firm nod of her head. &#x201c;Damn skippy.&#x201d;<br>Seated opposite me, my mother kicked my leg under the table while sending me a reproachful look across it. Next to her, my older sister, Kit, eyed me with the slightly superior expression she generally adopts whenever she perceives that I have stepped out of line. While I&#x2019;ve never actually caught her, I suspect she practices it in the mirror. Not that she needs much practicing. Kit has those angelic features that lend themselves perfectly to holier-than-thou looks. She inherited my mom&#x2019;s straight blond hair. I had ended up with my dad&#x2019;s curly brown hair, which looks just fine cut short and close to the head; grow it shoulder length and that&#x2019;s a whole other story. Add to that large blue eyes, perpetually clear skin, and a smirking mouth, and Kit looks like a smug Botticelli angel. I, on the other hand, have green eyes and freckles. Throw in the aforementioned chest issue and I&#x2019;m more likely to be compared to Botticelli&#x2019;s <i>Portrait of a Young Man</i>.<br>While I restrained myself from sneering at Kit, Aunt Winnie sent me a sly wink before demurely ducking her bright red head into a position of quiet respect.<br>Forcing myself not to roll my own eyes, I focused my attention on Bonnie just in time to hear her murmur again, &#x201c;Poor, poor Marty! I just don&#x2019;t see how this could have happened!&#x201d;<br>Bonnie was Martin&#x2019;s second wife. His first wife, Rose, died some twenty-five years earlier, leaving Martin in the unenviable position of sole parent to three young daughters. Although a savvy businessman who had built a family construction company into a national business, Martin was no match for the demands of parenthood and he knew it. Using the same cool determination he employed to build his multimillion-dollar business, he set out to remedy the situation the only way he knew how&#x2014;by remarrying. Of course it helped that he was both very rich and very handsome. Within two years, Bonnie McClay, a na�ve thirty-five-year-old secretary employed in the head office, was tapped for the role. It was one of only a handful of times where Martin&#x2019;s legendary acumen failed him, as Bonnie was even more helpless about children than Martin. Within three months, the children had dubbed their stepmother &#x201c;McClueless&#x201d; and commenced an unspoken war of resistance against her. Looking around me now, it appeared that the war still raged today.<br>We were sitting at a long table in the Hotel Washington&#x2019;s elegant Sky Terrace restaurant. Located on the hotel&#x2019;s rooftop, it afforded a spectacular view of Washington, D.C. The first strokes of autumn&#x2019;s vibrant hand were apparent in the nation&#x2019;s capital and the city was awash in color. A mosaic of purple, yellow, and red foliage reflected in the rippling waters of the Tidal Basin. Flora in riotous golden hues bloomed along the perfectly groomed grounds of the monuments. The monuments themselves stood tall and proud, the timeless lines of their crisp, white fa�ades majestic against the clear indigo sky.<br>As glorious as the view was, it couldn&#x2019;t hold a candle to the scene that was playing out around me. Clutching a lacy black handkerchief and gently dabbing it to her teary sapphire eyes, Bonnie sat like a Victorian queen in mourning. Swathed from head to toe in black, her outfit was faintly reminiscent of Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s garb in <i>Gone with the Wind,</i> the one she wears after her first husband, Charles, dies. In fact, I thought, as I peered closer at the dark, flowing dress, I wouldn&#x2019;t be at all surprised if it <i>were</i> an updated copy. Given Bonnie&#x2019;s flair for the dramatic, as well as her love of Margaret Mitchell&#x2019;s epic classic, it would be entirely within her dingbat character. (Bonnie was not only named for Scarlett&#x2019;s daughter, Bonnie Blue, but also had an annoying tendency to quote Scarlett&#x2019;s lines from both the book and the movie. A lot.)<br>Now, while I&#x2019;ve been known to quote my fair share of Jane Austen, I maintain that it is an entirely different habit. Muttering &#x201c;Capital! Capital!&#x201d; is one thing. Randomly calling out &#x201c;Fiddle-dee-dee!&#x201d; is quite another.<br>At Bonnie&#x2019;s insistence, Uncle Marty&#x2019;s burial flag had accompanied us to the restaurant. Tightly clutching the flag to her chest, Bonnie had advanced on the poor hostess and mournfully (and rather loudly) announced, &#x201c;My husband is dead. May I have some lunch?&#x201d; Hostesses in D.C., especially those in such close proximity to the Capitol, have seen their fair share of the odd and have as such developed a certain immunity to it. However, based on the way ours took a sudden step back and seemed incapable of speech, I think Bonnie managed to penetrate that professional fa�ade.<br>The flag now sat propped up in a chair next to hers. Not just any chair, mind you, but the chair at the head of the table. From time to time, Bonnie would glance at the flag and then quickly press the hankie to her quivering mouth. Like now.<br>Next to her, Frances, who at age thirty-five is the second eldest of Bonnie&#x2019;s stepchildren, gave a loud sigh of exasperation. Frances is something of the family expert on sighs of exasperation. Over the years, she&#x2019;s cultivated it into its present deep, melancholy, breathy sound. Hearing it, a stranger might legitimately expect to find that it originated from a kind of modern-day Marilyn Monroe rather than a dowdy plump woman with a penchant for tweed.<br>&#x201c;Bonnie,&#x201d; Frances said, running her fingers through her short nut-brown hair, &#x201c;Father had been ill for years. His passing is a blessing, really. He&#x2019;s in a better place now.&#x201d;<br>Bonnie lowered her black hankie and peered in astonishment at Frances. &#x201c;A better place?&#x201d; she echoed, her chin wobbling. &#x201c;A better place? How can you say that?&#x201d; With an accusatory gesture at the flag, she added, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in a coffin!&#x201d;<br>Frances blanched at this blunt, although apt, description of her father&#x2019;s whereabouts. Pursing her lips and studiously not looking at the flag, she tried again. &#x201c;What I meant is that he&#x2019;s no longer in pain. He&#x2019;s at peace.&#x201d; Frances&#x2019;s voice held the steely intonation that adults often use with petulant children, not that I ever heard Frances use it on her own kids. Steely intonations have no effect on Frances&#x2019;s twin boys. Referred to by the rest of the family as Thing One and Thing Two, they respond only to threats and bribes. It is only a matter of time before stun guns are employed.<br>Bonnie gave a loud sniff and raised the hankie back up to her eyes. &#x201c;Well, <i>he</i> may be at peace, but <i>I&#x2019;m</i> cer...</p><h2>The Surgeon and the Shepherd: Two Resistance Heroes in Vichy France</h2><p>Of the thousands of people who escaped through the Pyrenees during World War II, at least one hundred owe their lives to a daring scheme that Belgian Charles Schepens masterminded in Mendive, a remote Basque village near the French-Spanish border. The story of this near-miraculous resistance effort, an epic undertaking carried out in plain view of the Nazis, is recounted in full for the first time in <i>The Surgeon and the Shepherd</i>, an incredible, true tale of wartime heroism. <p>In 1942, in coordination with the Belgian resistance, Schepens stage-managed a highly secret information and evacuation service through the counterfeit operation of a back-country lumbering enterprise. This book traces Schepens&#x2019;s gradual transformation from an apolitical young ophthalmologist into double agent &#x201c;Jacques P�rot,&#x201d; and his emergence in the postwar period as a modern folk hero to the residents of Mendive. Woven into the account are the stories of a remarkable international cast of characters, most notably the Basque shepherd Jean Sarochar, regarded as a local misfit, with whom Schepens formed his most unlikely partnership and an enduring friendship.</p><p>Part biography, part spy tale, part cultural study, <i>The Surgeon and the Shepherd</i> is based on more than ten years of oral history research. The saga of a Belgian &#x201c;first resister&#x201d; who, by posing as a collaborator, successfully duped both the Germans and the local French Basque population, it offers a powerful and illuminating picture of moral and physical courage.</p></p><p>Meg Ostrum is a museum professional and arts consultant based in Vermont who has worked in the heritage preservation field for more than twenty-five years. She has edited several documentary studies and collections of oral histories, including <i>Visit&#x2019;n: Conversations with Vermonters</i>, an annual anthology published by the Vermont Folklife Center."During a hiking trip in the French Pyrenees in 1983, Ostrum stumbled upon a remarkable story of resistance to the Nazis. . . . [The conspirators'] compelling tale is only part of the story, as themes of class, modernity and deceit are handled gracefully by the author. . . . Ostrum has created a compelling work of 20th-century European history."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"A chance tourist encounter 20 years ago led museum professional and historical preservationist Ostrum to first learn of the intriguing tale she recounts in this accessible study. Biography, war story, and cultural history combined, it tells of two unlikely heroes who worked together in the Belgian resistance during World War II. . . . Using the interviewing skills of an oral historian and relying on careful detective work, Ostrum has pieced together a compelling and inspirational narrative that heralds the transforming effects of war.

He was once a wandering shramana &amp;, briefly, like thousands of others, he followed Gotama the Buddha, enraptured by his sermons. But this man, Siddhartha, wasn't a follower of any but his own soul. Born the son of a Brahmin, Siddhartha was blessed in appearance, intelligence &amp; charisma. In order to find meaning in life, he discarded his promising future for the life of a wandering ascetic. Still, true happiness evaded him. Then a life of pleasure &amp; titillation merely eroded away his spiritual gains until he was just like all the other "child people" dragged around by his desires. Like Hesse's other creations of struggling young men, Siddhartha has a good dose of European angst &amp; stubborn individualism. His final epiphany challenges both the Buddhist &amp; Hindu ideals of enlightenment. Neither a practitioner nor a devotee, neither meditating nor reciting, Siddhartha comes to blend in with the world, resonating with the rhythms of nature, bending the reader's ear down to hear answers from the river.--Brian Bruya (edited)</p><p></p><h2>The Mystique of Opium</h2><p>Whilst the 20th century was one long war for control of the world&#39;s oil supplies, opium was a key strategic raw material during the four preceding centuries. Opium consumption dates back to Ancient Egypt. Initially a useful pharmaceutical product called laudanum, it quickly became popular in Britain. It then became the basis for trade with isolationist China as soon as the Opium Wars obtained trading rights for Western companies and the Chinese began smoking it in industrial quantities.

Growing up in the center of declining British cotton mills amid hunger, smoke, strikes, and unemployment could be a depressing experience, but Woodruff's prose and Sam Kelly's fully voiced reading bring out the joys of first love, the devotion of a pet dog, and the humorous side of employment. Kelly picks up on the affection of a young boy for his proud but penniless grandmother and his enthusiasm for the simple entertainments of the pre-TV world. The local accent poses no problem; he also does a fair "Churchill," who speaks in the local square, and sings several songs on key. The narrative ends with Woodruff's departure for London in his teens; one looks forward to the sequel. J.B.G.

I know that sounds rather dramatic&#x2014;�sort of like: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Trust me, I&#x2019;ve been through both, but then I suspect everyone who breathes in oxygen has experienced this.<br><br> I started my career as a bank teller and eventually worked my way into the corporate office, taking on more and more responsibility. I liked my job and advanced quickly, but that driving ambition to succeed came with a price. I got so wrapped up and focused on my career I didn&#x2019;t have time for relationships. Oh, I had a few close friends, but when it came to dating and true love, I blew it off, thinking there would be time for all of that later.<br><br> Then one day I woke up and discovered the majority of my friends were married and raising families. When I did become interested in finding my soulmate, the men I dated, well, suffice it to say, and I&#x2019;m being as kind as I can be, were a sorry disappointment.<br><br> Then I met Paul Rose and I fell head over heels in love. Within the first week I knew he was the one. He was career military and hadn&#x2019;t married, either. It felt like a miracle that I would meet this wonderful man when I&#x2019;d given up hope of ever finding anyone.<br><br> Just like the lyrics of a country western song, we got married in a fever. Paul was an Airborne Ranger and a few months after he placed a diamond ring on my finger he shipped off to Afghanistan, then died in a helicopter crash.<br><br> It was as if life had hit me with an atom bomb.<br><br> My husband, whom I&#x2019;d loved so briefly, was forever gone from me. I&#x2019;ve read books that talk about the different stages of grief. They were filled with good advice, most of which I ignored. I was in so much emotional pain that I could barely function. It took every ounce of energy I could muster to force myself out of bed. Overnight everything, and I do mean everything, that I&#x2019;d once considered important&#x2014;�my career, my home, my lifestyle, my hopes and dreams of one day having a family with Paul&#x2014;�was gone in the blink of an eye.<br><br> Poof, destroyed.<br><br> Still reeling from the loss, I did the opposite of what everyone told me: Don&#x2019;t make an important decision the first year after the death of someone close. On a complete whim, I quit my corporate job and purchased a bed-�and-�breakfast and named it after my deceased husband. It became known as the Rose Harbor Inn. Rose, naturally, for Paul. And harbor because I&#x2019;d gambled that this next unexpected curve in the roadway of my life would become a harbor of healing for me. And, thankfully, it has. As a bonus, it seems the inn has the power to help others heal as well.<br><br> I seldom mention this insight to people for fear they&#x2019;ll suggest I consider counseling. Even now, almost four years later, I sometimes wonder if I&#x2019;d imagined that first night I spent after moving in. I&#x2019;d been half asleep . . . it might have been a dream. You know the kind where you aren&#x2019;t really asleep but not fully awake, either? Paul came to me in that dreamlike state, so real I was afraid to breathe for fear he would disappear. It felt as if all I had to do was reach out and touch him, but I knew I dared not.<br><br> While it was enough that he stood next to me, and I could see him and feel his love for me, as a bonus he spoke. Not that I heard the words out loud; they were spoken inside of me, in my heart.<br><br> I know it&#x2019;s hard to believe, but I swear that&#x2019;s what happened. He told me as plain as anything that I would heal here and all those who came to stay would find solace and healing of their own. Authentic or not, I&#x2019;ve held on to that promise, clung to it with both hands, desperately wanting it to be true. Desperately needed hope, a reason to continue.<br><br> When Paul told me I&#x2019;d heal, the last thing in my mind and certainly in my heart was the possibility of falling in love again. Finding Paul was miracle enough; I certainly didn&#x2019;t expect I could be so lucky again. But discovering love a second time was even more of a surprise than it was the first time. Certainly my relationship with Mark Taylor didn&#x2019;t start out as a lovefest, but I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself.<br><br> After my husband was killed, I retreated from life, which in retrospect is perfectly understandable. For two years I lived in a shell. I took up knitting and gardening, adopted a dog named Rover. All of these were things I&#x2019;d never have considered in my previous life.<br><br> The one constant the first two years I owned the inn was Mark Taylor, my handyman. He was grumpy, noncommunicative, and sometimes downright unpleasant. But as time progressed, Mark became a friend. I still found him irritating, but in a comforting sort of way. I suppose that doesn&#x2019;t make much sense, but it&#x2019;s the best way I can think to describe my feelings. In truth, it&#x2019;s hard to explain.<br><br> Mark was around the inn a lot, mainly because I hired him to do a variety of projects and odd jobs. After a while, despite our clashes and differences of opinion, we grudgingly became friends. We argued, but our disagreements weren&#x2019;t serious. I enjoyed teasing him. He loved my home-�baked cookies, and I found I could get him to do most anything with the promise of hot-�from-�the-�oven sweets.<br><br> The first time I laughed after learning about Paul was with Mark. He&#x2019;d been painting, and when climbing down the ladder he stuck his foot into a five-�gallon paint bucket. I thought it was hilarious and laughed until tears rained down my cheeks. Mark, however, wasn&#x2019;t amused.<br><br> Over the years he took on a number of projects I wanted done around the inn, which included building a rose garden and gazebo. I saw him nearly every day, and often more than once. Spending time with Mark became part of my daily routine. Even when he worked elsewhere he would invariably stop by the inn for coffee. We routinely sat on the porch and chatted about our day. There were times when we said nothing at all. We didn&#x2019;t seem to need words to communicate. Certainly there was no hint of romance; he was a friend and that was what I preferred. I was completely oblivious to the fact he might have come to care for me as more than that.<br><br> Just as I was coming out of my self-�enclosed shell, Mark let me know that he&#x2019;d fallen in love with me. His words shook me as powerfully as the 2001 Seattle earthquake. And then it hit me . . . and when I say that, I mean the shock of it turned me upside down. I discovered Mark had become more than a friend to me, too. Bottom line: I&#x2019;d fallen in love with him. It&#x2019;d been gradual&#x2014;�so gradual, in fact, that I wasn&#x2019;t even aware of the subtle shift of my feelings for him. This was so utterly different from falling in love with Paul that I remained oblivious to what had happened until Mark revealed his love for me.<br><br> No sooner did I come to accept that my heart was open and ready for Mark&#x2019;s love when he hit me with another shock. This one even bigger than the first. He announced he was leaving Cedar Cove, with no intention of returning.<br><br> What?<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t have a clue what that was about. He made no sense.<br><br> &#x201c;I love you, Jo Marie. Sorry, but I&#x2019;m leaving and I won&#x2019;t be back.&#x201d;<br><br> Who does that? And for the love of heaven, why? And then he was gone. Really gone. Sold-�his-�house gone. Gave-�his-�belongings-�away gone. Simply gone.</p><h2>Captain Vorpatril&#39;s Alliance (Miles Vorkosigan Adventures)</h2><p><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER in hardcover.&nbsp; With new cover treatment for trade paperback.<br> A new installment in the award-winning Vorkosigan science fiction adventure series.<br><br>Captain Ivan Vorpatril sometimes thinks that if not for his family, he might have no troubles at all. But he has the dubious fortune of the hyperactive Miles Vorkosigan as a cousin, which has too-often led to his getting dragged into one of Miles&#x2019; schemes, with risk to life and limb&#x2014;and military career&#x2014;that Ivan doesn&#x2019;t consider entirely fair. Although much practice has made Ivan more adept at fending off his mother&#x2019;s less-than-subtle reminders that he should be getting married and continuing the Vorpatril lineage.<br> <br>Fortunately, his current duty is on the planet Komarr as staff officer to Admiral Desplains, far from both his cousin and his mother back on their homeworld of Barrayar. It&#x2019;s an easy assignment and nobody is shooting at him. What could go wrong?<br><br> Plenty, it turns out, when Byerly Vorrutyer, an undercover agent for Imperial Security, shows up on his doorstep and asks him to make the acquaintance of a young woman, recently arrived on Komarr, who seems to be in danger. That Byerly is characteristically vague about the nature of the danger, not to mention the lady&#x2019;s name, should have been Ivan&#x2019;s first clue, but Ivan is no more able to turn aside from aiding a damsel in distress than he could resist trying to rescue a kitten from a tree.<br><br> It is but a short step down the road of good intentions to the tangle of Ivan&#x2019;s life, in trouble with the Komarran authorities, with his superiors, and with the lethal figures hunting the mysterious but lovely Tej and her exotic blue companion Rish&#x2014;a tangle to test the lengths to which Ivan will go as an inspired protector.<br> <br> But though his predicament is complicated, at least Ivan doesn&#x2019;t have to worry about hassle from family.

For years fans have clamored for Ivan Vorpatril&#x2019;s story, and at last Bujold delivers something that will both thrill the devoted audience and entrance new readers. For many years, Ivan has been perfectly content to live a quiet bachelor life and serve as a staff officer to a Barrayaran admiral. With no desire for the imperial throne or the types of death-defying adventures that his cousin Miles so adores, Ivan has become a master at avoiding political intrigue and entangling alliances. Asked to look after a young woman during a brief trip to Komarr, Ivan is happy to oblige. But when his attempt to ask the woman out ends up with her handmaiden knocking him out and tying him to a chair, Ivan realizes that something very bad is going on. It quickly becomes clear that the only way Ivan can save himself and his charge is to marry Tej Arqua and bring her home to Barrayar. Longtime readers will love seeing a new side of Ivan as well as hearing his views on many of the series characters. New readers can enjoy Ivan&#x2019;s story on its own but will miss many of the nuances that add depth and character; best to begin at the beginning. Essential for all SF collections and a must-read for Bujold and Vorkosigan fans. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: In the SF world, a new release doesn&#x2019;t get much bigger than this one.

From the tapering, beautiful head stare two slanting eyes, crimson and moody. He is Elric, Emperor of Melnibone, cursed with a keen and cynical intelligence, schooled in the art of sorcery -- the hero of Michael Moorcock&#39;s remarkable epic of conflict and adventure at the dawn of human history. 5 CDs, almost 6 hours of AudioBooksPlus entertainment! Read by Jeff West. Included is a dramatic introduction read by Michael Moorcock over 10 mins in length.</p><p><i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> is a requisite title in the hard fantasy canon, a book no fantasy fan should leave unread. Author Michael Moorcock, already a major player in science fiction, cemented his position in the fantasy pantheon with the five-book Elric saga, of which <i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> is the first installment. The book's namesake, the brooding albino emperor of the dying nation of Melnibon�, is a sort of Superman for Goths, truly an archetype of the genre. <p> The youthful Elric is a cynical and melancholy king, heir to a nation whose 100,000-year rule of the world ended less than 500 years hence. More interested in brooding contemplation than holding the throne, Elric is a reluctant ruler, but he also realizes that no other worthy successor exists and the survival of his once-powerful, decadent nation depends on him alone. Elric's nefarious, brutish cousin Yrkoon has no patience for his physically weak kinsman, and he plots constantly to seize Elric's throne, usually over his dead body. <i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> follows Yrkoon's scheming, reaching its climax in a battle between Elric and Yrkoon with the demonic runeblades Stormbringer and Mournblade. In this battle, Elric gains control of the soul-stealing Stormbringer, an event that proves pivotal to the Elric saga. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Born in London in 1939, Michael Moorcock now lives in Texas.

After the Berlin Wall went up in 1961, many tried to escape; of these, many were killed but most were captured--often calling upon the services of East German lawyer Wolfgang Vogel, who quickly became known for winning prisoners their freedom from East German jails, as well as from the country. Beginning with the Rudolf Abel/Francis Gary Powers exchange and peaking with the release of Anatoly Shcharansky, Vogel, working closely with his ``employer,'' the dreaded Stasi, negotiated the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners--but at a price. The Federal Republic of Germany paid out billions of marks over almost three decades, trading spies at border crossings in the dead of night. For his services, Vogel earned hundreds of thousands of marks and gained the respect of Western governments. But, Whitney shows, the lawyer had made a Faustian deal. While saving many East Germans from prison, he also helped bring about the downfall of his government masters, undermining his own future--for each release symbolically chipped away a bit of the Wall, and, in time, the pressure of would-be emigrants overwhelmed the East German government, bringing down Communist Party leader Erich Honecker and then the Wall itself. Some of the credit seems due to Vogel, who negotiated as hard with the Stasi for more releases as he did with the West for more money. Drawing on a great number of interviews, some with Vogel himself, Whitney offers a fascinating new perspective from which to view the rubble of East Germany and the secretive world of cold war spies.

Society was decorous, strict, and entirely stratified. Above all, it had but one leader, Mrs. Astor. It was she whom with the help of her friend and social confidant Ward McAllister, decided who was, and who was not, a member of Society-- a group limited to four hundred by the confines of the Astor mansion's stately ballroom.<br><br>Four years the press clamored to know who the Four Hundred were, who comprised the inner sanctum of Gilded Age Society? Mrs. Astor never in her life spoke with a journalist, but Ward McAllister often did. Famous for his flippant remarks and unwavering loyalty to Mrs. Astor and Society, he leaked the list to the <i>New York Times</i> in 1892. Instantly the term, "The Four Hundred," entered the national vocabulary, as a way to describe New York's hereditary elite: the Vanderbilts, the Van Rensselaers, the Goelets, the Stuyvesant Fish, the Chanlers....<br><br>Jerry E. Patterson, social historian and widely published author, brings the names on McAllister's list to life. Describing their lineage, wealth, exploits, and amusements, Patterson paints a vivid and remarkably human portrait of Gilded Age Society at its peak. In telling the story of the First Four Hundred, Patterson details the composition and lore of New York Society from the time the early Dutch settlers first broke bread through the Gilded Age and into the early part of the twentieth century. This telling history of New York's very rich is as much a history of the city itself as it is of social customs, dynamics, idiosyncrasies, and private architecture.<br></p><p><b>Jerry E. Patterson</b> has written many books including<i> Fifth Avenue: The Best Address</i>, <i>The Vanderbilts</i>, and <i>The Best Families: The Town and Country Social Directory, 1846-1996</i>.

She interweaves comparative mythology, early historical sources, linguistics, ethnography, and folklore to demonstrate conclusively that Goddess-worship is at the root of Western civilization. Illustrated with nearly 2,000 symbolic artifacts, Gimbutas' magnum opus is at once a "pictorial script" of the prehistoric Goddess religion and an authoritative work that takes these ancient cultures from the realm of speculation into that of documented fact. Over 500 illustrations.</p><p><b>Marija Gimbutas</b> was Professor of Archaeology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a prolific author of books on prehistory and archaeology.Bringing together archaeological evidence, comparative mythology and folklore, and symbolic interpretations, Gimbutas's work asserts the existence in prehistoric Europe of a widespread culture centered on the Goddess, lifegiver and sustainer, as well as death-wielder. Through the examination of hundreds of Paleolithic and mostly Neolithic pieces, the author traces cross-cultural and cross-chronological symbolic parallels, some of which are quite broad and open to several types of inference. The central and venerated position of women in the unconscious of early European people seems probable; this order of things changed with the incursions by Kurgan groups (4300-2800 B.C.) and the European world moved "from matrilineal to patrilineal." Whether or not one agrees with these archaeomythological interpretations, Gimbutas offers a thought-provoking symbolic reading of hundreds of selected pieces, beautifully reproduced in this sizeable compendium.<br><i>- Winnie Lambrecht, Brown Univ., Providence, R.I.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>RED ARMY</h2><p>Explores the human side of the Red Army as they invade West Germany and force a desperate response by the U.S. and its NATO allies</p><p>Contemporary fiction with a war-fighting theme demands an obliging enemy who tests one's strengths and virtues to their limits, but ultimately makes the right decisions--and the right mistakes--to secure a favorable outcome for the "good guys." Western authors from Sir John Hackett to Tom Clancy have assigned that role to the Soviet Union. Peters, a Soviet analyst, Russian linguist and military intelligence officer, reverses the image in this brilliantly executed military procedural that tells the story of a future conventional war on the NATO central front entirely from a Soviet perspective. He eschews national policy, grand strategy, and high-tech gadgetry to focus on the mentalite of the modern Soviet soldier, from marshall to rifleman. Fusing knowledge of Soviet fighting techniques and Russian history, he presents credible military situations and characters who are archetypes rather than stereotypes. Readers will find here neither the military primitives described by Viktor Suvorov and Alexander Cockburn, nor the mirror-images based on U.S. models that dominate so much recent fiction. Peters's Red Army is by no means a perfect military instrument, but it knows how to fight. And it recognizes a fundamental truth: wars are won by the side making the fewest mistakes. In these pages, NATO becomes the obliging enemy whose errors of planning and execution contribute to a Soviet victory that is as well-deserved as it is hard-fought.

It has since become a symbol of the extraordinary literary ferment of that time. It was then that Alexander Blok composed his apocalyptic sequence &#x201c;Twelve&#x201d;; that the futurists Velimir Khlebnikov and Vladimir Mayakovsky exploded language into bold new forms; that the lapidary lyrics of Osip Mandelstam and plangent love poems of Anna Akhmatova saw the light; that the electrifying Marina Tsvetaeva stunned and dazzled everyone. Boris Pasternak was also of this company, putting together his great youthful hymn to nature, <i>My Sister, Life</i>.<br><br> It was a transforming moment&#x2014;not just for Russian but for world poetry&#x2014;and a short-lived one. Within little more than a decade, revolution and terror were to disperse, silence, and destroy almost all the poets of the Stray Dog cabaret.</p><p>Paul Schmidt wrote many award winning translations. He held a Ph.D in Slavic Literature from Harvard and was a professor of Russian literature at the University of Texas and Wellesley College. His critical essays appeared in The Nation, The New York Review of Books, and Delos.

She edited&nbsp;<i>Amy Lowell: Selected Poems</i> for the Library of America and is author of <i>The White Blackbird</i>, a life of her grandmother, the painter Margarett Sargent.A professor of Russian whose translations included the plays of Anton Chekhov and the avant-garde writings of Velimir Khlebnikov, Schmidt (1934-1999) also worked with the director and composer Elizabeth Swados on what would have been groundbreaking musical settings for famous lyric poems and sequences from the great era of Russian modernism, set in the caf�-the Stray Dog-where modernists gathered. The theatrical work never appeared, but those drafts became this book, a memorial to the time-beginning around 1906, and concluding after Stalin's rise to power-when Alexander Blok and Anna Akhmatova created pellucid elegiac stanzas, Osip Mandelstam meditated on existential dilemmas, Vladimir Mayakosky exploded into radical free verse, and Khlebnikov obliterated the line between prophecy and nonsense. Apparently the first original publication from the New York Review imprint (exclusively a reprint house until now), this collection makes an ideally readable introduction to this sometimes forbidding, internationally admired, poetic group. Fin-de-siecle concerns of love in caf�s, of "sun and song," flirtation and regret, give way to darker worries as the Russian Revolution runs its course: Blok and Boris Pasternak sound particularly effective in Schmidt's libretto-like, clarified versions, while Akhmatova-grown older, immersed in sorrow-proposes a toast "to the terrible world we inhabit/ And to God, who never replied." Editor Catherine Ciepela offers a long and useful introduction, along with capsule biographies of Schmidt's eight poets; poet and biographer Honor Moore adds an epilogue not seen by PW.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now each driver revved his engine in an unspoken agreement to race the short, straight distance to the big city square directly ahead.</p><p> As the signal flashed green, the squeal of rubber peeling off on concrete echoed hundreds of meters down in the main square. Bystanders turned to watch as the high-performance machines lurched from the intersection, each keeping pace with the other and accelerat�ing at breakneck speed.</p><p> Roaring past the midpoint of the race at more than 200 kilometers per hour, Jaks suddenly lost control, clipping the Porsche and careen�ing into a huge metal lamp post. In an instant, the competition was over, with neither car the winner. The BMW was sliced in two, the Porsche a smoldering, crumpled wreck close by. The drivers of both cars crawled and limped away from the scene, but the BMW's passenger-a promising twenty-three-year-old Internet entrepreneur named Nikolai McColo-was killed instantly, his almost headless body pinned under the luxury car.</p><p> "Kolya," as McColo was known to friends, was a minor celebrity in the cybercriminal underground, the youngest employee of a family-owned Internet hosting business that bore his nickname-McColo Corp. At a time when law-enforcement agencies worldwide were just waking up to the financial and organizational threats from organized cybercrime, McColo Corp. had earned a reputation as a ground zero for it: a place where cybercrooks could reliably set up shop with little worry that their online investments and schemes would be discovered or jeopardized by foreign law-enforcement investigators.</p><p> At the time of Kolya's death, his family's hosting provider was home base for the largest businesses on the planet engaged in pumping out junk email or "spam" via robot networks. Called "botnets" for short, these networks are collections of personal computers that have been hacked and seeded with malicious software-or "malware"-that lets the attackers control the systems from afar. Usually, the owners of these computers have no idea their machines have been taken hostage.</p><p> Nearly all of the botnets controlled from McColo were built to blast out the unsolicited junk spam advertisements that flood our inboxes and spam filters every day. But the servers at McColo weren't generating and pumping spam themselves; that would attract too much attention from Internet vigilantes and Western law-enforcement agencies. Instead, they were merely used by the botmaster businesses to manipulate millions of PCs scattered around the globe into becoming spam-spewing zombies.</p><p> By the time paramedics had cleared the area of Kolya's accident, gruesome images of the carnage were already being uploaded to secre�tive Russian Internet forums frequented by McColo's friends and business clients.... This was a major event in the cybercrime underworld.</p><p> Days later, the motley crew of Moscow-based spammers would gather to pay their last respects at his service. The ceremony was held at the same church where Kolya had been baptized less than twenty-three years earlier. Among those in attendance were Igor "Desp" Gusev and Dmitry "SaintD" Stupin, coadministrators of SpamIt and GlavMed, until recently the world's largest sponsors of spam1-and two figures that will play key roles in this book.</p><p> Also at the service was Dmitry "Gugle" Nechvolod, then twenty-five years old and a hacker who was closely connected to the Cutwail botnet. Cutwail is a massive crime machine that has infected tens of millions of home computers around the globe and secretly seized control over them for sending spam. To this day, Cutwail remains one of the largest and most active spam botnets-although it is almost undoubtedly run by many different individuals now (more on this in Chapter 7, "Meet the Spammers").</p><p> So why is it important to note these three men's presence at such a momentous event for cybercrime? Because their work (as well as Kolya's and hundreds of others) impacts every one of us every day in a strange but seriously significant way: spam email.</p><p> Indeed, spam email has become the primary impetus for the devel�opment of malicious software-programs that strike computers like yours and mine every day-and through them, target our identities, our security, our finances, families, and friends. These botnets are virtual parasites that require care and constant feeding to stay one step ahead of antivirus tools and security firms who work to dismantle the networks. </p><p> This technological arms race requires the development, production, and distribution of ever-stealthier malware that can evade constantly changing antivirus and anti-spam defenses. Therefore, the hackers at the throttle of these massive botnets also use spam as a form of self-preservation. The same botnets that spew plain old spam typically are used to distribute junk email containing new versions of the malware that helps spread the contagion. In addition, spammers often reinvest their earnings from spamming people in building better, stronger, and sneakier malicious software that can bypass antivirus and anti-spam software and firewalls. The spam ecosystem is a constantly evolving technological and sociological crime machine that feeds on itself.</p><p> Given the increasing menace of spam email and related cybersecurity assaults that directly affect consumers and companies (like the major news story I broke to the media in December 2013 about the Target credit-card database breach-a cyberattack that compromised millions of Americans' financial information and forced an even greater number of us to get new credit cards), you may be wondering why governments, law-enforcement officials, and corporations aren't taking a stronger and more significant stance to stop the tidal wave of spam and cybercrime impacting us all.</p><p> Part of the reason is that many policymakers and cybercrime experts tend to dismiss spam as a nuisance problem that can be solved or at least mitigated to a manageable degree by the proper mix of technology and law enforcement. For many of the rest of us, spam has become almost the punch line of a joke, thanks to its close association with male penile-enhancement pills and erectile dysfunction medica�tions such as Viagra and Cialis. We assume that if we don't open the emails or don't purchase anything from them, we aren't affected.</p><p> Unfortunately, that attitude underscores a popular yet funda�mental miscalculation about the threat that spam poses to every one of us.</p><p> </p></p><h2>Maxwell: The Outsider</h2><p>Traces the life of the controversial British publisher, recounts how he built his empire, and examines the charges of mismanagement that surfaced after his mysterious death</p><p>Publishing mogul Robert Maxwell drowned in November 1991. By December this book was being readied for publication. Originally published in Britain in 1988 amidst much legal ballyhoo, it never made it to the States--Maxwell saw to that. It is newly updated, exhaustively researched, and, at times, tediously detailed, especially concerning Maxwell's fi nancial dealings; it is also an even-handed account of a powerful and destructive egomaniac. Bower writes, "This is a story about a man who used and abused people, who aroused fervent loyalty, fear and disdain among otherwise rational and strong human beings, and whose reputation suffered the misfortune of his best attempts to offer his truth." Other accounts of Maxwell were also published in 1988: Joe Haines's Maxwell (Macdonald, a Maxwell company) and Peter Thompson's Maxwell: A Portrait of Power (Bantam). This is an important addition to communications, history, business, and even legal collections, as it is also a study of censorship and terrorism.

His arranged marriage to a beautiful Norman heiress would be duty and no more. But more than duty stirs his blood when he first sees Ariane. She has known only coldness from men and a betrayal so deep it all but killed her soul. Wanting no man, trusting no man, speaking only through the sad songs she draws from her harp, Ariane comes to Simon an unwilling bride. They wed to bring peace to the disputed lands, but marriage alone is not enough. Simon must teach Ariane passion, she must teach him trust. And both must surrender to the sweet violence of love&#x2032;s enchantment. . .or die. </p></p><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell has more than eighty titles published to date with over twenty-four million copies of her books in print. She lives in the Sierra Nevada Mountains with her husband, with whom she writes novels under a pseudonym. Her favorite activity is exploring the Western United States to find the landscapes that speak to her soul and inspire her writing.</p>In this third installment of her medieval trilogy, Elizabeth Lowell brings us back to her magical eleventh-century world with Ariane&#39;s story. Ariane the Betrayed is willing to marry Simon the Loyal in order to bring peace to the Disputed Lands, but that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s prepared to fulfill her marital duties, thus setting up the conflict that lasts throughout the story. Ariane believes she is without a heart, and Anne Flosnik portrays her despair with a dull, lifeless delivery. The slow-moving story is not helped by Flosnik&#39;s careful narration. However, she is enchanting with her portrayals of the supporting characters, the warrior knights and the wise learned with special powers.

A whimsical cumulative tale that is a treat to read aloud.<br><br>Follow the trail of mishaps that happen--all because of a silly old bee!</p><p>"I was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1944. Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.<p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years. I have always like hearing stories from these folks. My genuine curiosity for the wonder of living a very long life prepared me to accept the declining years of my own parents.</p><p>"To get back to the farm in Union City...this place was so magical to me that I have never forgotten it! This was the place where I heard such wonderful stories told...this was the place that a real meteor fell into our font yard...that very meteorite is now our family headstone in the graveyard here in Union City.</p><p>"Did I tell you that I now live in Union City? This is after living in Oakland, California for almost 37 years. But, you see, every year I'd come back to Michigan to see my Dad and family.</p><p>"Anyway...</p><p>"In 1949 we left the farm to move, first to Coral Gables, Florida. I lived there with my Mom and my brother, Richard, for almost 3 years. Then we moved to Oakland, California. I remained there for most of my young life on into my adulthood. We lived on Ocean View Drive in the Rockridge District. What I loved the most about this neighborhood is that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike.</p><p>"It is on Ocean View that I met my best friend, Stewart Grinnell Washington. We are best friends to this day! He has a younger brother, Winston and three sisters; Jackie, Terry and Robin. When I was a student in elementary school I wasn't a very good student. I had a terrible time with reading and math. As a matter of fact, I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber. When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school. Of course, now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact, most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! Once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well.</p><p>"I went on to University, majored in Fine Art, then went on to do a graduate degree and even ended up with a Ph.D. in Art History. For a time I restored ancient pieces of art for museums. I eventually became the mother of two children, Steven and Traci, and devoted much of my days to their education and upbringing.</p><p>"I did not start writing children's books until I was 41 years old. Mind you the "art" has always been there for me most of my life. Apparently one of the symptoms of my disability in academics is the ability of draw very, very well. So drawing, painting and sculpture has always been a part of my life even before I started illustrating my books. The books were quite a surprise, really. Mind you, I came from a family of incredible storytellers. My mother's people were from the Ukraine and Russia...my father's people were from Ireland. My extended family,(Stewart's family) were from the bayous of Louisiana...also great story tellers. When you are raised on HEARING stories.....NOT SEEING THEM, you become very good at telling stories yourself. So at the age of 41 I started putting stories that I told down on paper and did drawings to help illustrate them...I guess the rest is history.</p><p>"I have enjoyed a wonderful career of writing books for children . Who could have guessed that little girl that was having such a tough time in school would end up an illustrator and author. Children and adults alike ask me where I get my ideas...I get them from the same place that you do....MY IMAGINATION... I would guess the reason my imagination is so fertile is because I came from storytelling and, WE DID NOT OWN A T.V.!!!!!!!!! You see, when one is a writer, actor, dancer, musician; a creator of any kind, he or she does these things because they listen to that "voice" inside of them. All of us have that "voice". It is where all inspired thoughts come from....but when you have electronic screens in front, of you, speaking that voice for you... it DROWNS OUT THE VOICE! When I talk to children and aspiring writers, I always ask them to listen to the voice, turn off the T.V. and</p><p>"LISTEN...LISTEN...LISTEN.</p><p>"Now that I have moved back to Union City I am intending to open my house and community and invite people to come there to take part in writing seminars, story telling festivals, literature conferences and various events that celebrate children's literature."</p><p>Born Patricia Ann Barber in Lansing, Michigan, to parents of Russian and Ukrainian descent on one side and Irish on the other, Patricia Polacco grew up in both California and Michigan. Her school year was spent in Oakland, California, and summers in her beloved Michigan. She describes her family members as marvelous storytellers. "My fondest memories are of sitting around a stove or open fire, eating apples and popping corn while listening to the old ones tell glorious stories about their homeland and the past. We are tenacious traditionalists and sentimentalists.... With each retelling our stories gain a little more Umph!"</p><p>Studying in the United States and Australia, Patricia Polacco has earned an M.F.A. and a Ph. D. in art history, specializing in Russian and Greek painting, and iconographic history. She is a museum consultant on the restoration of icons. As a participant in many citizen exchange programs for writers and illustrators, Patricia Polacco has traveled extensively in Russia as well as other former Soviet republics. She continues to support programs that encourage Russo-American friendships and understanding. She is also deeply involved in inner-city projects here in the U.S. that promote the peaceful resolution of conflict and encourage art and literacy programs.</p><p>The mother of a grown son and a daughter, Patricia Polacco currently resides in Michigan, where she has a glorious old farm that was built during the time of Lincoln.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

A boy who drops his book to look at a bee causes the waiter to trip, splashing a drink on a matron, forcing ladies to trip and spill their tea, resulting in a man face down in the dessert tray, who jostles the chef, and so forth. The rhyme scheme gets the better of Polacco, with awkward rhythms that deviate from the pattern. As the chaos spreads, the lines become jarring: ``Here comes Enzo, full of spaghetti, chasing his cat, whose name is Lettie, hoping to catch her, but she thinks not and runs through the room, wearing the pot that was jostled and spilled.'' The result is a glorified food fight. The illustrations are crowded with swarms of restaurant-goers whose mouths show perpetual astonishment, but the staging is clumsy, too. Readers cannot follow the action as it is choreographed in the scenes, e.g., the waiter is suspended mid-air for two spreads, implying a short passage of time, while another man in those pages goes from a relaxed pose sitting behind a table to running away in panic some distance from the scene, indicating that the time that has lapsed is longer.

We live in and through a complex set of relationships we hardly notice. These insights affirmed by new physics and old mystics alike provide the foundation for Quantum Grace, a book of compelling daily Lenten reflections. Author Judy Cannato invites us during the season of Lent to look at our beliefs, decisions, and actions and the ways they affect our personal lives and the lives of others. She shows us that &#34;remaining vulnerable to the divine presence, allowing God to expose the places in our hearts that suffer from the illusion that we are separate and apart--this is the real work of Lent, and it is a co-creative activity that requires us to be honest with God so that God can be honest with us.&#34; Intended for individual reflection, but also ideal for group use, Quantum Grace offers a unique and valuable approach to the Lenten experience.</p><p>Judy Cannato is spiritual director at St. Joseph Wellness Center in Cleveland, Ohio, as well as a retreat director and Certified Mid-Life Directions Consultant. She has master&#39;s degrees in education and religious studies from John Carroll University and is the author of numerous articles on spirituality.Spiritual director Judy Cannato explores the relationships of human beings to creation in Quantum Grace: Lenten Reflections on Creation and Connectedness, a book intended for individual reflection during the Lenten season. Like many other authors, Cannato goes day-by-day through Lent, offering the standard format of Scripture readings, a meditation and questions for reflection. Unlike others, however, she focuses her lens on "connectedness," drawing upon the new physics "as a framework from which to consider human experience of the divine." According to Cannato, recent developments in science confirm ancient mystics' hypotheses about the interdependence of all life. Cannato's science-and-religion approach is unique among Lenten devotionals. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Art of Ritual</h2><p>Rituals mark life&#39;�?s momentous and symbolic events: from special birthdays and holidays to personal affairs such as a child&#39;�?s first day of school or the death of a beloved pet.

From the intro: &#34;Be it known to your charity, that being dull in intellect and rude of speech, I have presumed to deliver these things in the Latin tongue, not trusting to my own learning, which is little or none at all, but partly from traditions of our ancestors, partly from writings and monuments of the ancient inhabitants of Britain, partly from the annals of the Romans, and the chronicles of the sacred fathers, Isidore, Hieronymus, Prosper, Eusebius, and from the histories of the Scots and Saxons, although our enemies, not following my own inclinations, but, to the best of my ability, obeying the commands of my seniors; I have lispingly put together this history from various sources, and have endeavored, from shame, to deliver down to posterity the few remaining ears of corn about past transactions, that they might not be trodden under foot, seeing that an ample crop has been snatched away already by the hostile reapers of foreign nations. For many things have been in my way, and I, to this day, have hardly been able to understand, even superficially, as was necessary, the sayings of other men; much less was I able in my own strength, but like a barbarian, have I murdered and defiled the language of others. But I bore about with me an inward wound, and I was indignant, that the name of my own people, formerly famous and distinguished, should sink into oblivion, and like smoke be dissipated. But since, however, I had rather myself be the historian of the Britons than nobody, although so many are to be found who might much more satisfactorily discharge the labour thus imposed on me; I humbly entreat my readers, whose ears I may offend by the inelegance of my words, that they will fulfil the wish of my seniors, and grant me the easy task of listening with candour to my history. For zealous efforts very often fail: but bold enthusiasm, were it in its power, would not suffer me to fail. May, therefore, candour be shown where the inelegance of my words is insufficient, and may the truth of this history, which my rustic tongue has ventured, as a kind of plough, to trace out in furrows, lose none of its influence from that cause, in the ears of my hearers. For it is better to drink a wholesome draught of truth from the humble vessel, than poison mixed with honey from a golden goblet.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Orpheus Process</h2><p>Dr. Helmond discovers a method of reanimating the dead with a violet amniotic fluid, but he oversteps the bounds of science when he tries the experiment on his senselessly murdered daughter who is revived, but altered</p><p></p><h2>Legacy&#39;s Gift (Thoroughbred)</h2><p><p>Allie, now sixteen years old, is just one win away from becoming a full&#x2013;fledged jockey.

Well-known Bible passages take on new dimensions when seen in the perspective of a sweeping panoramic overview. A person desiring to minister to other must also develop the spiritual depth which comes from biblical knowledge. The three-volume series Broadening Your Biblical Horizons will help you attain these goals. No book, however, can ever substitute for studying the Bible itself. Nor can the most capable person apply the Bible&#39;s message to another person&#39;s life. You will benefit most from this study if you first read the portion of the Word of God being considered as many times as possible from various good translations. Then ask yourself, &#34;What does the Word say to me?&#34; Applying what the Bible says to current living will result in a truly rewarding experience.</p><h2>Using the Drill Press: Techniques for Better Woodworking (The Workshop Companion)</h2><p>Discusses selection and maintenance of drill presses; working with metal and plastics, making screw pockets, mortice-and-tenon joints, toy wheels, rosettes, and includes instructions for several projects.</p><p></p><h2>An Act of God: Previously Published as The Last Testament: A Memoir by God</h2><p>***<i>An Act of God</i> (previously published as <i>The Last Testament: A Memoir</i>) is now a major Broadway show starring Emmy Award winner Sean Hayes and directed by Joe Mantello (<i>Wicked</i>)***<br><br>Over the course of his long and distinguished career, God has literally seen it all.

and darkness had fallen upon the face of the entire publishing industry.<br> <br>3&nbsp;So one day Daniel, my agent, whom I have been with forever; by which I do not mean literally &#x201c;forever,&#x201d; as I started out unrepresented, but a good 25 years or so;<br> <br>4&nbsp;Anyway, Daniel got us a table at Balthazar; for he knows someone there.<br> <br>5&nbsp;So we met, and exchanged pleasantries, and sat down, and caught up; and in time I coyly came around to asking him why he wanted to see me, although I knew, and he knew that I knew, and I knew that he knew that I knew; but lo, this is how the game is played.<br> <br>6&nbsp;And then, over a fris�e aux lardons that they were not serving in heaven then, but they are now, he spoke unto me:<br> <br>7&nbsp;&#x201c;O LORD our God, King of the Universe, here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m thinking.<br> <br>8&nbsp;Thy previous books have sold an impressive six billion copies;<br> <br>9&nbsp;They form the basis of three great religions, and five crappy ones;<br> <br>10&nbsp;They have been translated into 2,453 languages, including that of a fictional race of TV aliens wearing shoe polish;<br> <br>11&nbsp;They can be found in every synagogue, church, mosque, and Comfort Inn in the world;<br> <br>12&nbsp;And most importantly, they have done for faith, and ethics, and morality, what The Bartender&#x2019;s Bible hath done for bartending.<br> <br>13&nbsp;But lo, it has been nigh on 14 centuries since thy last book&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>14&nbsp;&#x201c;Forget not The Book of Mormon,&#x201d; I interrupted.<br> <br>15&nbsp;&#x201c;Thy last serious book,&#x201d; he continued; &#x201c;and now a pestilence has befallen our tribe; books go unread; bookstores go unpatronized; libraries remain Dork Central;<br> <br>16&nbsp;And while digitalization presents an opportunity, it is also a challenge; the paradigm is shifting; I don&#x2019;t know if thou dost follow the trades, but content-wise&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>17&nbsp;&#x201c;I follow everything!&#x201d; I bellowed, using the reverb voice and thunder-rumbling sound that I am wont to employ on such occasions.<br> <br>18&nbsp;&#x201c;Forgive me, LORD,&#x201d; said Daniel; &#x201c;I shall rend my garment and grovel in thy sight later.<br> <br>19&nbsp;I mean only to say, that if I were to approach major publishing houses with a proposal for God&#x2019;s last testament, it would make a pretty strong pitch.&#x201d;<br> <br>20&nbsp;&#x201c;But of what shall it be composed?&#x201d; I asked, pressing my fork into the poached egg, then idly watching its liberated amber yolk ooze seductively over the farm-fresh chicory.<br> <br>21&nbsp;&#x201c;For I have already imparted all my wisdom, and bestowed all my law, and revealed all my truth;<br> <br>22&nbsp;And also I confess to being sore afraid, that I may not have another book in me&#x201d;;<br> <br>23&nbsp;And at this I sighed, and turned away, and did earnestly wonder if I still &#x201c;had it.&#x201d;<br> <br>24&nbsp;And Daniel said, &#x201c;Surely this is not the same confident, All-Powerful God who parted the Red Sea, and bore his son through a virgin mother, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, I&#x2019;ve never read the Koran, but I&#x2019;m sure thou didst some amazing things in there also.<br> <br>25&nbsp;Besides, the book I envision is not like unto those.<br> <br>26&nbsp;For in the book I envision, thou wouldst revisit thy greatest hits&#x2014;the Old and New Testaments, and the Koran if thou insistest&#x2014;but in a manner more in keeping with the modern custom;<br> <br>27&nbsp;Meaning, that thou shalt &#x2018;open up&#x2019; about their events; and &#x2018;share&#x2019; thy feelings; and &#x2018;dish&#x2019; about the various public figures therein, thus creating a &#x2018;telleth-all.&#x2019;<br> <br>28&nbsp;(That&#x2019;s not a bad title, by the way.)<br> <br>29&nbsp;Then thou shalt continue the tale by describing thy activities and whereabouts over the past one thousand four hundred years; a period I suspect many of thy devotees have a few questions about.<br> <br>30&nbsp;And then thou shalt finish with a sneak peek into the future, with perhaps a brief glimpse of what lies in store for the end of the world; which, again, I think may be of some interest to thy hardcore fans.<br> <br>31&nbsp;But checketh it out, for here is the best part: Interspersed throughout shall be a series of short essays on matters of contemporary interest; such as natural disasters, and America, and celebrities, and regional athletic contests, and whatever other bits of frivolity thou conceivest;<br> <br>32&nbsp;The better to cater to the sensibilities of the modern reader, whose capacity for following unbroken written narrative hath dwindled to the size of a piece of Jonathan Franzen&#x2019;s neck-stubble.<br> <br>33&nbsp;My point, G-Man&#x201d;&#x2014;and here Daniel reached across the table and grabbed the hem of my garment in a way few ten-percenters have ever done without an insta-smiting&#x2014;<br> <br>34&nbsp;&#x201c;Is that I love thee as a deity, and worship thee as an author; so I would have thee find new favor among men, by coming down off thy pedestal and humanizing thyself,<br> <br>35&nbsp;That thou might once again top the best-seller list, only this time in the modern era:<br> <br>36&nbsp;An era in which, I would remind thee, royalties can be properly accounted for.&#x201d;<br> <br>37&nbsp;Then he fell silent; and long I pondered.<br> <br>38&nbsp;Yea, long I pondered; until slowly the ancient desire to spread my word among man that he may glorify me, began to stir in my spirit once more.<br> <br>39&nbsp;And the waiter came and separated Daniel&#x2019;s check from mine;

Not the scholarly type, the Vikings left only scant runes as their written record. Scottish archaeologist and historian Oliver takes clues from their contemporaries, burial remnants, and other cultural activities to tell their story. Instead of assuming the perspectives of the terrified writer of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, or Alcuin, or the Venerable Bede, or Tacitus, he takes the opposite point of view. And though one might question the objectivity of an author so clearly enamored with his subject, the result is a fascinating tale of explorers, chieftains, warlords, and a resourceful, stalwart people of immense seafaring prowess. Beginning before the sacking of Lindisfarne in C.E. 793, Oliver details their exploits from Kiev to Newfoundland, and the startling way they may have affected the Battle of Hastings in 1066&#x2014;thereby changing the course of history&#x2014;all of which makes for riveting reading. Though the book&amp;'s organization is somewhat choppy, anyone interested in finding out more about these real-life raiders will enjoy everything Oliver reveals.

Organized chronologically, the volume explores the emergence of Zionism in Europe against the backdrop of relations among Jews, Arabs, and Turks, and the earliest pioneer settlements in Palestine under Ottoman rule. Weaving together political, social, and cultural developments in Palestine under the British mandate, Shapira creates a tapestry through which to understand the challenges of Israeli nation building, including mass immigration, shifting cultural norms, the politics of war and world diplomacy, and the creation of democratic institutions and a civil society. References to contemporary diaries, memoirs, and literature bring a human dimension to this narrative history of Israel from its declaration of independence in 1948 through successive decades of waging war, negotiating peace, and building a modern state with a vibrant society and culture.

Now, for the first time ever, Jack has agreed to open this bizarre and darkly beautiful world to other fantasists, to play in as their very own. To say that other fantasy writers are excited by this prospect is a gross understatement; one has told us that he'd crawl through broken glass for the chance to write for the anthology, another that he'd gladly give up his right arm for the privilege. That's the kind of regard in which Jack Vance and The Dying Earth are held by generations of his peers.<br><br>This book contains original stories from George R. R.

In <i>Songs of the Dying Earth</i>, 22 sci-fi and fantasy writers, from newcomers like Liz Williams and Byron Tetrick to established names like Neil Gaiman and George R.R. Martin, each offer their own snippets of Vance's Dying Earth. In one story, an apprentice architect stumbles into a duel between two powerful mages, for example, while in another a poet-philosopher tries (and fails) to forget the coming apocalypse in a drunken haze. Some stories capture Vance's style and inventiveness, while others recreate his perfect combination of black humor and creeping dread. <i>Songs of the Dying Earth</i> is both a respectful homage to a sci-fi master and a whirlwind tour of a world that readers will want to revisit. <i>--Darryl Campbell</i>George R.R.

She swallowed and resettled herself in the chair, making sure the best side of her face was toward Trent and the flounce of her polonaise that fell to the floor was &#x201c;just so.&#x201d; She could feel his presence before he came into view, and she wondered at this thing inside<br>her heart, this thing that would not die, that stirred for him more than any other. What was it about Trent Storm?<br>&nbsp;<br>He entered the room as if he owned it, looking elegant in new attire. He peeled off his gloves and coolly perused her. &#x201c;Tora,&#x201d; he said with a nod and then a slight smile. There was something hopeful in his eyes, and Tora was glad for it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Trent!&#x201d; she said in a surprised tone, as if she had forgotten he was coming, and went to him. He bent over her hand and kissed it, then held it in his warm, strong fingers as they stared at each other. After a long, intense moment Tora squirmed. &#x201c;It has been a while, Trent.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, well, things at home have kept me quite busy. Helena is a few miles from Duluth, mind you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Please sit down,&#x201d; she said with a grand gesture, hoping he would notice the neorococo furniture just in from France. He sat without hesitation. &#x201c;Yes, but we haven&#x2019;t seen each other for what? Five months?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Counting, darling?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora frowned. His eyes were alive with challenge, and the air was suddenly charged with energy. &#x201c;No, not at all. I simply was commenting. I&#x2019;ve certainly been busy enough establishing new roadhouses&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve not had time to count the hours until seeing you again.&#x201d; She hoped the edge of sarcasm in her voice would deflate whatever dangerous balloon was rising between them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Quite. The facilities here are quite impressive. Not to mention this house.&#x201d; He glanced around. &#x201c;Very nice. I trust you did this with only your own funds.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora scowled. This was not going at all as she had planned. &#x201c;Of course, Trent,&#x201d; she said, hating the defensiveness in her tone. &#x201c;I wanted to build a house in which I could entertain &nbsp;&nbsp;important guests, but moreover, a <i>home</i>. I had to borrow a certain sum from the bank, but they were happy to assist such a prominent&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A home?&#x201d; Trent interrupted, rising and walking to a window that stretched from the floor to the twelve-foot ceiling. He parted the velvet drapes and looked outside. &#x201c;Hmm. A home. Something that reminds you of Bergen?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora felt the blood drain from her face. &#x201c;Bergen? Why, it has been years since I&#x2019;ve thought of Norway. No, I was thinking of someplace&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Like Camden?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Camden-by-the-Sea?&#x201d; she managed to ask without her voice rising an octave. Where was he going with this? &#x201c;No, what I started to say was&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That you needed a home,&#x201d; he put in.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said, staring back into his eyes when he studied her.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A sense of place.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I suppose so.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A place where you know who you are, and others do as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#x2019;s the reason for this grand showcase of a home, correct? The three-story, overdone, showy Queen Anne of the Storm Roadhouse Maven?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora rose, thoroughly alarmed now. &#x201c;Trent, whatever is wrong with you? I had so hoped you would like it, so treasured the idea you might want&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What? To live here?&#x201d; He shook his head once, decisively. &#x201c;No, Tora. I do not even know who the Storm Roadhouse Maven is. You have not allowed it. How could I marry you? How could I come and make a home with you? You have grown more distant in the time I&#x2019;ve known you, wrapped up in your own vision of the future and a very tangled net of lies.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Of...of lies?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Trent pulled a yellowed paper from the inside pocket of his jacket and quietly unfolded it. &#x201c;The Heroine of the Horn,&#x201d; he read aloud. He stared down at her. &#x201c;Elsa Anders Ramstad. Your long-lost sister. Here&#x2019;s the amusing part, though. She apparently does not remember<br>being lost. In fact, she seems to have a very solid idea of who she is and where she has come from.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You...you spoke to her?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He ignored her question. &#x201c;You told me she was dead. Do you think that she claims the same of you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora sat down, hard. &#x201c;Perhaps in some sense she does,&#x201d; she muttered, half to herself.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That is the first honest thing I&#x2019;ve heard from you in a long time.&#x201d;<br>Tora sighed and stared toward the window. She knew it was the end; this was the reason for Trent&#x2019;s growing distance. He knew. He&#x2019;d known for a long time. And her secrecy had driven him further and further away, even as she sought to draw him closer. &#x201c;How did you find out?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Some detective work. I so wanted you to confide in me, Tora.&#x201d; He spoke as if he were talking about someone else, a distant relation. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me? Why the secrecy? Was I untrustworthy? What is so humiliating in your past that you could not simply tell the truth? Not enough drama for you? Tora Anders,&#x201d; he said with a shake of his head and a sigh, &#x201c;you could have been a star on the stage. You&#x2019;ve put on quite a performance these last four years. For a while, I told myself it didn&#x2019;t matter, that you must have your reasons. Probably a silly pride thing, or whatnot. But it kept eating at me, and I couldn&#x2019;t let it go. Last month, I decided enough was enough. If you couldn&#x2019;t be honest with me, we certainly had little hope for a future.&#x201d; He turned to her, his voice full of anguish. &#x201c;Why, Tora? Why did you not tell me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She could feel his stare but could not find it within herself to meet his gaze. &#x201c;Tell you? When we first met, you were my employer! It was easier, cleaner if I came to you as an orphan. And as to Camden, and the baby, I couldn&#x2019;t tell you all of that. <i>Trent Storm </i>would never have hired an unwed mother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>When he did not respond, Tora quickly looked at him. The stricken expression on his face spoke volumes&#x2014;he hadn&#x2019;t known! He hadn&#x2019;t known <i>all </i>of it! Looking suddenly ten years older, Trent sat down hard on the settee. Tora rose and went to him, kneeling at his feet and resting her face on his thigh. &#x201c;Oh, Trent!&#x201d; Tears came unbidden. &#x201c;Trent, I did it to survive. If you had known I was less than the wholesome woman you hired to work in your facilities, would you ever have employed me, much less courted me? I had to do it! I wanted to do something important with my life. To do this,&#x201d; she said, waving about her. &#x201c;And soon I was doing it as much for you as I was for me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;At the expense of a child,&#x201d; he said numbly. &#x201c;Where, Tora? Where did you leave your baby?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In a good home,&#x201d; she said simply.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Look at me,&#x201d; he said sharply, raising her chin forcefully. &#x201c;The child lives?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I hope so,&#x201d; she whispered. For the first time in years, Tora felt a sense of relief in sharing the burden of her secret with another.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You feel sorrow over your decision?&#x201d; His eyes never wavered.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Occasionally. But not for some time. There&#x2019;s so much more to my life now&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Trent laughed a mirthless laugh and rose, as if brushing her off. &#x201c;Do you realize how heartless you sound? God wants a different woman for me, Tora. A woman with heart and passion. Not perfect. I am far from a sinless man myself. But I fancy that I face up to my mistakes. I expect nothing less of a woman I would love.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>So that was what this was all about? Some overblown sense of judgment? Why, he didn&#x2019;t know her! He didn&#x2019;t know what she had gone through to get to this station.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You are dead to me, Tora Anders,&#x201d; Trent said simply, walking to the door with heavy footsteps. &#x201c;You are fired and no longer associated with Storm Enterprises.&#x201d; Tora&#x2019;s mouth dropped, and her heart thudded dully. &#x201c;I&#x2014;I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You are on your own,&#x201d; he said, walking to the doorway. He turned back once. &#x201c;I sincerely hope, Tora, that one day you will find your way home.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And with that he was gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Karl was not sure why, but after supper that evening he decided on a walk. Casually, he asked directions toward Tora Anders&#x2019;s home, and gradually made his way there. She sat by herself in the front garden, sipping from a tall crystal glass and looking morose. It stunned him to see her again. She was as lovely as ever, her dark hair done up on top<br>in an elaborate knot, her clothing impeccably fine. <i>What does it cost to find dresses like that in the Montana territory? </i>he wondered briefly.<br>&nbsp;<br>He stood at her iron gate, transported in time to their voyage six years before when he discovered Tora had stowed away aboard the <i>Herald</i>. She was an imp of perhaps sixteen then; now she was a grown woman. His mind flickered to her older sister&#x2014;the woman he had longed for who had ultimately cost him his best friend. Had Elsa grown in beauty as her younger sister had? Quickly he pushed the thought from his mind. He had seen Tora at social events on Trent Storm&#x2019;s arm in years past, but something was different about her<br>tonight. She looked somehow lost, troubled.<br>&nbsp;<br>Karl chastised himself at the protectiveness that rose in his breast. Whatever sadness she felt, Tora probably brought on herself. He cleared his throat.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora looked up at once and a small smile raised the corners of her perfect mouth. &#x201c;Why, Karl Martensen. Here in Montana!&#x201d; She rose and waved him in. &#x201c;Please, join me. Would you care for some lemonade?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It sounded like an uncommon luxury to Karl, having citrus in a mountain town, and he nodded quickly. &#x201c;Tora,&#x201d; he said in greeting, bowing his head as he took off his hat and hugged it to his chest. He did as she bid and sat beside her on the garden bench, while Tora told a maidservant to bring more lemonade.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pleased to see you, Karl,&#x201d; she said, a note of weariness in her voice. &#x201c;It has been a most unpleasant day.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am sorry to hear that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes. Perhaps you can take my mind off it. I refuse to dwell on the unpleasant! Tell me of you! It has been what? Three years?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Four, at least,&#x201d; Karl responded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen your work along the Northern Pacific. Our paths, surprisingly, have not crossed, although your reputation and expertise have not escaped me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, well, apparently my reputation and expertise are not enough for Trent Storm.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He saw fit to sever our business relationship this afternoon.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Karl, understanding at once why Tora was less than her normal self. &#x201c;And your personal relationship?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It was dead long ago. I had a schoolgirl&#x2019;s dream of what it could be. Trent let life interfere.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Life?&#x201d; Karl asked carefully.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora glanced at him sharply. &#x201c;Yes. I told him the truth, and he could not handle it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;About your daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. He just cast me away like so much riffraff.&#x201d; She pulled a handkerchief from somewhere in the folds of her dress and dabbed at her eyes. &#x201c;Can you imagine?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Karl fought a smile. Here was the Tora Anders he remembered, manipulative to the end. &#x201c;I can,&#x201d; he said softly. &#x201c;You must have hurt him deeply. What was it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora sniffed, as if offended, then sagged a bit. &#x201c;Well, to secure a job with Storm Enterprises I had to present myself as a woman with no ties. Free to do as they bid. As Trent bid.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No ties. No child?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;As well as other things.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Karl let her comment slide. &#x201c;I see. So he just found out about your baby?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes. I do not see what difference it makes! She isn&#x2019;t a part of my life. He would have no responsibility for her!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Perhaps that is just what he wanted.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora laughed, laughed as if it was a tremendous relief to do so, then soon sobered. &#x201c;You think Trent <i>wants </i>a family?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know few men who don&#x2019;t. Maybe he was simply waiting all these years for you to be honest with him, to show him who you really are, rather than who you want to be.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora rose, color flaming on her cheeks. &#x201c;Who are you to presume to judge me? You know nothing of who I am, let alone who I will be.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Karl stood beside her, sensing their time together was already at an end. He silently lamented not having the chance to sip lemonade, to catch up with a woman who shared some of his history. He laughed at himself. He was apparently so lonely that he even felt led to reach out to Tora Anders! &#x201c;I beg to differ, Tora. I know who you are. I&#x2019;ve known<br>you all your life.&#x201d; He brushed a tendril of dark hair from her eyes as she shied away, clearly irritated at his overly familiar gesture. &#x201c;On the other hand, I do not know who you will be.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh. And who are you now, Karl Martensen? Still the philanderer in sad pursuit of my married sister?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Karl winced at the truth of her comment and forced himself to stare back into her eyes. &#x201c;I made a fool of myself and wasted some of the best friendships I ever made. I made a mistake and then I walked away before apologizing. Are you letting Trent do the same?&#x201d; Bile rose in his throat. How long would he be haunted by past sins? He seemed unable to recapture any sense of peace in his life. Even Tora could see it, use it.<br>&nbsp;<br>She ignored his question. &#x201c;I think you should go.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I will.&#x201d; He turned to depart, then looked back at her. &#x201c;What will you do?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; she said, as if miffed that he dared question her. &#x201c;I have investments, and ideas of my own about what to do along the railroad.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You intend to compete with Trent?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Did I say that? I said I had plans of my own.&#x201d; She smiled in feline fashion, and Karl knew that it was exactly what she was scheming.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Trent would be furious. Believe me, you don&#x2019;t want an enemy like him on the line.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Like Hall?&#x201d; she baited him, reminding Karl of his infamous past employer.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll note that I found it prudent to develop my own business along the Northern Pacific, rather than the Great Northern. Villard has gone broke again,&#x201d; he said, referring to the chief financier behind the Northern Pacific, &#x201c;so who knows what will transpire along this route. It might be wise to consider moving, and for reasons beyond<br>Trent.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And leave all this?&#x201d; she asked, her eyebrows raised in surprise.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Never. Helena is my home, and a perfect base of operations along the Northern Pacific.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Karl cocked one eyebrow and pursed his lips. &#x201c;It is your decision, obviously. I&#x2019;m simply saying it&#x2019;s always wise to diversify.&#x201d; He turned to go and was at the gate when she called out to him, her tone hesitant.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Karl! Tell me...have you heard from my sister or Peder?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He gave her a small smile. &#x201c;Not for years. Peder and I had a parting of the ways. Last I heard, they had built a second home in Seattle. Running lumber from the Washington Territory back east. You should write. I bet Elsa would appreciate hearing from you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tora sniffed and shrugged her shoulders a bit. &#x201c;Perhaps. I have heard of things more crazy than that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Good-bye, Tora.&#x201d;</p><h2>Maps of America the Beautiful</h2><p>A collection of 30 maps drawn especially to accompany this curriculum.

Yet most people don't have the luxury of time and need cash to cover their day-to-day expenses. To that end, nationally renowned real estate expert Ron LeGrand has developed a method of buying real estate to generate cash that he calls "quick turning." Over the past 15 years, he has bought and sold more than a thousand properties for fast-cash profit using the method. In <i>How to Be a Quick Turn Real Estate Millionaire: Make Fast Cash with No Money, Credit, or Previous Experience</i>, LeGrand shares this system for building long-term wealth. With wit and wisdom, he outlines four main categories of "quick-turn" transactions: retailing, wholesaling, assumptions, and lease/options. He helps readers understand which type of transaction is appropriate for their specific cash flow goals, and he reveals how-to secrets that real estate investors, and wannabe investors, can use to: <br>* Get rich on fixer-uppers without lifting a hammer. <br>* Find motivated sellers. <br>* Negotiate win-win deals. <br>* Sell houses fast. <br>* Succeed while others fail.</p><p><b>Robert G.

Cowboys sang songs about him, and newspapers had frequently printed scandalous accounts about the malicious Mormon destroying angel. But to many, Rockwell was a guardian angel, and it could easily be said that he saved far more lives than he took. It seems history tells two contrasting narratives about one of the West&#39;s most controversial men. Yes, at times Porter Rockwell could act violently, yet he was overly generous to those in need. At least two dozen people died at his hand, yet in every instance he was exonerated. As the ninth person baptized into the restored Church, Porter was central to the early growth of the Church, even though he was never called to a position of leadership. He was called a saint and a sinner, a lawman and a criminal, a hero and a villain. Indians feared him, saying he was impossible to kill, but some people traveled hundreds of miles to try. Although his death by natural causes likely disappointed the many outlaws seeking his life, it also fulfilled a prophecy given by Joseph Smith that no bullet or blade would ever harm Porter Rockwell. A friend of Joseph Smith&#39;s since childhood and later his bodyguard, Rockwell saved the life of the Prophet more than once. Porter also served as a bodyguard to Brigham Young and helped guide the first pioneers across the plains to the Salt Lake valley. He became a legend as a frontiersman, a marksman, and a man of iron nerve. And though many outsiders characterized Porter Rockwell as a notorious, vengeful murderer, those who knew him saw a protector, a miraculous healer, and a loyal friend. Stories From the Life of Porter Rockwell is not a biography, nor is it fiction. It is a collection of accounts about Porter Rockwell that provide insight into his character, his incredible physical stamina and skill, and his devotion to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. While others of his time acted differently than he, his life was a legitimate and lawful response to the world in which he lived. These are the stories that his contemporaries found significant.</p><p>John W. Rockwell has spent his life teaching students history, especially U.S. history and the history of the Wild West.

Equally rich in both technique and theory, this book will be a reference standard for generations. <p>From the Foreword by Robert Hand:<br> This book on progressions is quite accessible to astrological readers of many levels, but it is not a beginner's book. It does not just give the basics of progressions. It goes beyond that to provide a practical and theoretical foundation for integrating the various methods of progressions into a single body of method...Blaschke's theory is that these three types of progression derive their usefulness from the following relationships. Secondaries are the result of the interaction of the Earth and the Sun (day and year) which in turn correlate to Matter and Spirit. Tertiaries are the result of the interaction of the Earth and the Moon (day and month) which correlate to Matter and Soul. And finally minors are the result of the interaction of the Moon and the Sun (month and year) which correlate to Soul and Spirit...This is technically a very rich book and one which teaches a definite method which would not be difficult to apply in practice...this book should advance the study of progressions in astrology on both the practical and theoretical level and for this we owe Robert Blaschke a vote of thanks.</p></p><p>Robert P. Blaschke, owner of Earthwalk School of Astrology in Portland, Oregon USA, is a full-time professional teaching and consulting astrologer.He is a past-president of both the Oregon Astrological Association and Washington State Astrological Association, and past National Coordinator of the ISAR (International Society for Astrological Research) Professional Astrology Speakers Bureau. He has lectured at both regional and national astrology conferences in the U.S. and Canada, and has been a requested speaker for several local astrological associations. For years he has taught classes and workshops at community colleges, various bookstores and at his own astrology school. His articles have appeared in <i>The Mountain Astrologer</i>, <i>KOSMOS</i>, <i>NCGR memberletter</i>, <i>The Journal of AstroPsychology</i>, <i>The Ascendant</i>, <i>Astraea Astrology</i>, <i>Ralta</i> and other publications.Blaschke is an excellent teaching writer. He knows exactly how to introduce his material in small, precisely measured increments, cite his authorities with clarity and brevity, and guide the reader through virtually frustration free assimilation and mastery of progression theory and application. After reading this book and working within the guidelines presented, many of us might begin to wonder why we had not learned these techniques sooner. The answer is that there probably weren't enough teachers or writers of this man's caliber available when we first began the study and practice of astrology. -- <i>Joan Star, Geocosmic Magazine</i><br><br>I was completely delighted with this book and his findings and I love his metaphysical and spiritual approach to the subject. Robert has covered all the elements that are needed in the understanding and use of progressions, making it easy for any student or seasoned astrologer to incorporate them into their work...I highly recommend this book. It should be in every astrologer's library. This book is a very pleasing and enlightening read! -- <i>Lynda Hill, FAA Journal- Australia</i><br><br>In this interesting and useful book Robert Blaschke describes how he combines secondaries, tertiaries and minors - the three progression cycles of a day for a year, a day for a lunation and a lunation for a year - into a single approach for prediction and counseling purposes...I can recommend this book. The ideas and the writing are fresh and stimulating. There is much in it that can aid the astrologer in his or her practice. -- <i>Ken Gillman, Considerations Journal</i><br><br>There are not many books on the market on progressions. This is the only one that I know of that discusses progressions from a philosophical and metaphysical perspective. This is a highly original work, one that doesn't rehash what is found elsewhere but rather builds on it. What you will find in this book is a very well-thought-out framework for linking secondary, tertiary, and minor progressions.

Set in Louisiana and narrated by various members of the Walker family, <i>Little Altars</i> tells the tragicomic tale of Siddalee's magnificently dysfunctional clan. There is hard-drinking Viviane, who alternately adores her children and abuses them, and Daddy Big Shep, who is inarticulate, alcoholic, and can't quite say what he means and seldom means what he yells. Sidda's siblings are a mess, the family servants are badly treated, and though Rebecca Wells includes many hilarious set pieces throughout, even the Ya-Yas can't completely overcome the dark core at the center of this novel. <p> Wells continues the saga of Sidda and Vivi Walker in her follow-up, <i>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</i>, and this time the mood is considerably lightened as she takes her characters back in time via a collection of letters, clippings, and scrapbooks--the "divine secrets" of the title. Here a younger, more sympathetic Vivi shares the limelight with her Ya-Ya pals, Teensy, Caro, and Necie. From skinny-dipping in the town water tower to boozing it up at the spring cotillion, these Southern-fried hell-raisers prove what everyone has always suspected--that "it's so much <i>fun</i> being a bad girl!" But you don't have to be bad to enjoy Rebecca Wells's take on family, friendship, and the ties that bind for a lifetime. <i>--Margaret Prior</i></p><p>Writer, actor, and playwright Rebecca Wells is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Ya-Yas in Bloom</em>, <em>Little Altars Everywhere</em>, and <em>Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</em>, which was made into a feature film.

The Crusades gave rise to the Military Orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, and were a backdrop to the careers of some of history&#39;s most famous leaders including Richard &#39;The Lionheart&#39; and Saladin. On occasion the savagery of the Crusaders left their opponents reeling, creating frictions that survived for more than 700 years. At the same time, as this book lavishly illustrates, art, architecture and learning all benefited from new knowledge the Crusaders brought back from the East.</p><p>This unique series studies every major war in history looking at all the aspects of war, from how it felt to be a soldier to the lasting impact of the conflict on the world around it.A series of books on the history, organisation, appearance and equipment of famous fighting men of the past and present; and on other aspects of military history which demand fuller and more flexible coverage.</p><h2>AIA Guide to New York City</h2><p>Since the <b>AIA Guide to New York City</b> was first published in 1967, it has been recognized as the ultimate guide to the metropolis's buildings, in all five boroughs -- Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island -- from nineteenth-century brownstones and tenements to modern high-rise apartments and museums.

Eisenhower guided the United States through the Suez Canal crisis of 1956. The crisis climaxed in a tumultuous nine-day period fraught with peril just prior to the 1956 presidential election, with Great Britain, France, and Israel invading Egypt while the Soviet Union ruthlessly crushed rebellion in Hungary. <br><br>David A. Nichols, a leading expert on Eisenhower&#x2019;s presidency, draws on hundreds of documents declassified in the last thirty years, enabling the reader to look over Ike&#x2019;s shoulder and follow him day by day, sometimes hour by hour as he grappled with the greatest international crisis of his presidency. The author uses formerly top secret minutes of National Security Council and Oval Office meetings to illuminate a crisis that threatened to escalate into global conflict. <br><br>Nichols shows how two life-threatening illnesses&#x2014;Eisenhower&#x2019;s heart attack in September 1955 and his abdominal surgery in June 1956&#x2014;took the president out of action at critical moments and contributed to missteps by his administration. <br><br>In 1956, more than two thirds of Western Europe&#x2019;s oil supplies transited the Suez Canal, which was run by a company controlled by the British and French, Egypt&#x2019;s former colonial masters. When the United States withdrew its offer to finance the Aswan Dam in July of that year, Egypt&#x2019;s president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, nationalized the canal. Without Eisenhower&#x2019;s knowledge, Britain and France secretly plotted with Israel to invade Egypt and topple Nasser. <br><br>On October 29&#x2014;nine days before the U.S. presidential election&#x2014;Israel invaded Egypt, setting the stage for a &#x201c;perfect storm.&#x201d; British and French forces soon began bombing Egyptian ports and airfields and landing troops who quickly routed the Egyptian army. Eisenhower condemned the attacks and pressed for a cease-fire at the United Nations. <br><br>Within days, in Hungary, Soviet troops and tanks were killing thousands to suppress that nation&#x2019;s bid for freedom. When Moscow openly threatened to intervene in the Middle East, Eisenhower placed American military forces&#x2014;including some with nuclear weapons&#x2014;on alert and sternly warned the Soviet Union against intervention. <br><br>On November 6, Election Day, after voting at his home in Gettysburg, Ike rushed back to the White House to review disturbing intelligence from Moscow with his military advisors. That same day, he learned that the United Nations had negotiated a cease-fire in the Suez war&#x2014;a result, in no small measure, of Eisenhower&#x2019;s steadfast opposition to the war and his refusal to aid the allies. <br><br>In the aftermath of the Suez crisis, the United States effectively replaced Great Britain as the guarantor of stability in the Middle East. More than a half century later, that commitment remains the underlying premise for American policy in the region. <br><br>Historians have long treated the Suez Crisis as a minor episode in the dissolution of colonial rule after World War II. As David Nichols makes clear in <i>Eisenhower 1956, </i>it was much more than that.</p><p>David A.

I am getting to be a big boy now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eisenhower to Sherman Adams, October 26, 1955, a month after his heart attack<br> <br><b>DWIGHT EISENHOWER</b> had not enjoyed a vacation so much in years. He had pleased Mamie by agreeing to spend the six-week vacation at the home of Mamie&#x2019;s mother, Elvira Doud, in Denver, but his part of the bargain was a five-day, men-only fishing trip to Byers Peak Ranch. Once at the ranch, Eisenhower, as his physician Howard Snyder put it, was &#x201c;as full of contentment as I had ever seen.&#x201d; The group was made up of old friends&#x2014;the host, Aksel Nielsen, a friend, George E. Allen (not to be confused with assistant secretary of state George V. Allen), assistant press secretary Murray Snyder, and the physician. They were later joined by another longtime Eisenhower friend, Robert L. Biggers of Chrysler Corporation.<br> <br>As the outing&#x2019;s final day approached, Ike made a decision worthy of a commander-in-chief: on Friday, September 23, the president of the United States would cook breakfast. The night before, he challenged the men to show up the next morning with &#x201c;a he-man&#x2019;s appetite&#x201d; because he was planning to cook a &#x201c;despideda&#x201d; (farewell) breakfast.1<br> <br>Eisenhower bounded out of bed at 5:00 A.M., ready to commence his culinary duties. Dr. Howard Snyder was the first to arrive at the president&#x2019;s cabin. He had enjoyed the walk, gazing at the blue-gray outline of Byers Peak in the distance, and breathing in the crisp, cool, 35 degree morning air. When Snyder entered the cabin, the president was just emerging from his bedroom, in full stride toward the kitchen. The president boomed a greeting: &#x201c;What are you doing up so early, Howard?&#x201d;<br> <br>As the others arrived, Eisenhower decreed that no one but he would be permitted in the kitchen. About 6:30, they sat down and indulged, according to Snyder, in &#x201c;special Eisenhower corn cakes, eggs, sausages, ham, blackeyed peas, and red-eye gravy.&#x201d; After breakfast, their vehicles already packed, the party journeyed over the twelve-thousand-foot Berthoud Pass, arriving at the Doud home about 8:30 A.M. The group split up and Eisenhower continued on to his office at Lowry Air Force Base in Denver.<br> <br>Intent on playing golf, Ike conducted his presidential business expeditiously. Colonel John H. McCann provided the president&#x2019;s morning intelligence briefing, including news that gave Eisenhower pause. Ike betrayed no hint of that concern to Ann Whitman, who had &#x201c;never seen him look or act better.&#x201d;2<br> <br>About 11:00 A.M., the president departed for the Cherry Hills Country Club, where he teed off at noon for an 18-hole round. Up to the 14th green, Eisenhower was, Howard Snyder recalled, &#x201c;exuberant&#x201d; about his game. Then he was interrupted with a message that he had a phone call from Secretary of State Dulles. Returning to the clubhouse, Ike was told that the secretary was en route to an engagement and would call again in an hour. The president returned to his golf game. Snyder overheard Ike grumbling about &#x201c;an unnecessary call&#x201d; and his game, in Snyder&#x2019;s terms, &#x201c;went to pot&#x201d; between the 14th and 18th greens. Ike returned to the clubhouse &#x201c;in a bad humor&#x201d; for lunch.3<br> <br>About 2:30 Ike teed off for a second round but his game was disrupted three more times by calls from Dulles, two of them unsuccessful in connecting Ike with the secretary. Dr. Snyder noted that the president was so irritated at these intrusions that &#x201c;the veins stood out on his forehead like whipcords.&#x201d; The one call that got through was important. The day before, Dulles had addressed the United Nations General Assembly on the American proposal for Arab-Israeli peace in the Middle East&#x2014;code-named Alpha&#x2014;that Dulles had announced on August 26. Now that plan was in jeopardy. Dulles confirmed to Eisenhower in his phone call that the Soviet Union was preparing to provide &#x201c;a massive lot of arms&#x201d; to the Egyptians. He had experienced &#x201c;a little rough time&#x201d; in New York, discussing the matter with Molotov, the Soviet foreign minister. The British and French were &#x201c;alarmed&#x201d;; Dulles feared the Israelis might launch a preemptive attack on Egypt because &#x201c;today they can lick them easily.&#x201d;4<br> <br>Eisenhower replied that he had been briefed about &#x201c;the Egyptian thing&#x201d; that morning and had been &#x201c;churning it around.&#x201d; The president expressed concern that the Russians &#x201c;are considering giving arms to a country in an area where it will cause trouble.&#x201d; Dulles suggested a presidential communication to Soviet premier Bulganin. Eisenhower agreed&#x2014;he was already obligated to respond to a September 19 message from Bulganin on disarmament&#x2014;but he wanted to think about it overnight. Ike told Dulles he would call him the following morning.5<br> <br>That phone call was never made.<br> <br> <b> <b>DUAL CRISES</b> </b> <br> <br>After the conversation with Dulles, Ike returned to his golf game but quit after nine holes. The president began to experience what he thought were symptoms of indigestion. His discomfort gradually increased during the rest of the day. Eisenhower declined his usual evening drink because, Dr. Snyder recalled, &#x201c;he did not feel well in the middle.&#x201d; The president had little appetite at dinner and retired early.6<br> <br>On Saturday morning, September 24, just after nine, Secretary Dulles discussed the Egyptian situation with the CIA director, his brother Allen, who reported that &#x201c;the facts seem pretty firm&#x201d; about the Egyptian arms deal. Foster did not think they would get far in talking with the Egyptians. Any protests should be directed at the Soviets.7<br> <br>The brothers were unaware that another crisis had been building for hours in Denver. At the Doud home in the middle of the night, Mamie Eisenhower had arisen to go to the bathroom. She passed the door of the president&#x2019;s room, heard him making noises in his sleep, and stopped by his bed to ask whether he was having a nightmare. Ike replied, &#x201c;No dear, but I thank you.&#x201d; Ten minutes later, he was at her bedside, saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a pain across the lower part of my chest.&#x201d; Since he had complained about indigestion, Mamie gave her husband milk of magnesia.8<br> <br>At 2:54 A.M., Mamie called Howard Snyder. Snyder recognized the &#x201c;distinct note of alarm&#x201d; in the first lady&#x2019;s voice and sent for a car. Eisenhower had suffered frequent stomach upsets through the years; a late-night visit to the president&#x2019;s bedside was not unprecedented. At 3:11 Snyder arrived at the Doud residence. Upon seeing the president, the doctor listened to his chest and took his blood pressure. Ike&#x2019;s pulse was very rapid and the doctor found it difficult to get a good blood pressure reading.<br> <br>Ike was &#x201c;agitated and complaining of severe pain across his chest.&#x201d; Over the next few minutes, Snyder gave the president amyl nitrite to sniff and injections of papaverine hydrochloride, morphine tartrate, heparin, and, later, a second shot of morphine. Suddenly the president went into what Snyder later called &#x201c;a state of shock.&#x201d; His blood pressure plummeted and his pulse became even more irregular.<br> <br>Instead of calling for an ambulance, Snyder asked Mamie to climb into bed and embrace the president. Snyder later wrote that &#x201c;this had the desired effect almost immediately.&#x201d; Eisenhower went back to sleep a little after four&#x2014;probably due as much to the morphine as Mamie&#x2019;s embrace. By this time, Snyder believed that he was dealing with a heart attack, but he chose to let the president rest from the trauma.<br> <br>At 5:45 A.M., Snyder called Ann Whitman to say the president might not be into the office until ten o&#x2019;clock or later. Murray Snyder, the assistant press secretary, should tell the press that the president had experienced a &#x201c;digestive upset.&#x201d; When the fifty-plus reporters clamored for more information, Whitman called the doctor back and asked him how serious the episode was. Snyder responded that the president was asleep and &#x201c;his digestive upset was not serious.&#x201d; That was a lie; Ann Whitman took the doctor&#x2019;s reassuring response at &#x201c;face value&#x201d; and passed it on to Murray Snyder.9<br> <br>The president slept until 11:30 A.M. Dr. Snyder constantly monitored his blood pressure and pulse as he slept; once the pressure dropped to a dangerously low 86 over 56. Only then did Snyder call Denver&#x2019;s Fitzsimons Army Hospital and request a cardiac specialist to administer an electrocardiogram. The cardiologist, General Byron Pollock, arrived about 1:00 P.M.<br> <br>Pollock quickly concluded that the president had suffered &#x201c;a massive infarct,&#x201d; i.e., significant damage to the tissues of the heart. The president was told that he must go to the hospital. Even then, Snyder did not order an ambulance. Instead, he called for a Secret Service car. Whitman later said that Eisenhower walked down the stairs to the car, but Snyder&#x2019;s account says that, due to the difficulty of using a stretcher on the stairs, two big Secret Service agents carried the president down the stairs. He then walked to the car.<br> <br>Arriving at the rear entrance of Fitzsimons, Eisenhower was placed in a wheelchair and rolled to an elevator, ascending to the eighth floor, where the VIP suite was located. Once in his room, the president was placed in an oxygen tent&#x2014;an action that surprised him. This may have been the moment when Ike began to realize that he was being treated for a serious heart attack.<br> <br>About 1:45 P.M., Ann Whitman, Murray Snyder, and other staffers left Lowry Air Force Base for the Famous Chef, a nearby restaurant, for a late lunch. As they began to eat, Murray was called to the phone. He returned to inform the group that the president had suffered &#x201c;a mild anterior coronary thrombosis.&#x201d; Ann Whitman also received a call; the message was that the president wanted her to call the attorney general to ask him how authority could be delegated during his illness. They paid for their uneaten lunch and rushed back to the base. Ann Whitman believed that &#x201c;we&#x2014;and perhaps the world&#x2014;knew that he had an attack of thrombosis before the President himself knew.&#x201d;10<br> <br> <b> <b>GOVERNING WITHOUT IKE</b> </b> <br> <br>The administration&#x2019;s first crisis in Middle East policy, mixed with the president&#x2019;s heart attack, only exacerbated the disarray that afflicted the Eisenhower team. In the months to come, the Egyptian arms deal would evolve into a major threat to peace. And the president was out of action at its inception.<br> <br>Such situations seem destined to arise on a weekend when key people are unavailable. Congress was in recess. The chief of staff, Sherman Adams, was in Europe at the president&#x2019;s request, reviewing NATO operations. Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr., was on vacation in Spain. On that rainy Saturday in Washington, Jim Hagerty, the press secretary, was enjoying his first vacation in years, although he had stayed in the capital. Hagerty returned home from golfing about four o&#x2019;clock and picked up the afternoon edition of the <i>Washington Star,</i> noting a two-column box at the bottom of the page, reporting that a digestive upset had kept the president from going to his office that morning. Hagerty, assuming nothing serious, lay down for a nap.11<br> <br>About 4:30 P.M., Hagerty&#x2019;s special White House phone began to ring incessantly&#x2014;a signal the call was urgent. The press secretary picked up the receiver and Murray Snyder was on the other end: &#x201c;Jim, Dr. Snyder has just called me and told me that the President has suffered a heart attack.&#x201d; Hagerty felt like he had been &#x201c;slugged&#x201d;; he was sure his own heart was skipping beats. Snyder told Hagerty that he intended to tell the press that the president had endured &#x201c;a mild coronary thrombosis.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hagerty knew he must leave for Denver immediately. While his wife packed his clothes, the press secretary frantically scribbled a to-do list on a scratch pad. The phone rang; it was Vice President Richard Nixon. &#x201c;Dick, sit down,&#x201d; Hagerty said. &#x201c;The President has had a heart attack.&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, my God,&#x201d; the vice president responded. &#x201c;When, how bad is it?&#x201d; Hagerty did not know. Nixon expressed the feelings of the Eisenhower team: &#x201c;We all need the President.&#x201d;<br> <br>The conflicting accounts of those first hours reflect the turmoil that afflicted the Eisenhower staff. In Denver, Ann Whitman was stacking up five or six phone calls at a time. Hagerty and Wilton B. &#x201c;Jerry&#x201d; Persons, the assistant chief of staff and congressional liaison, agreed that the press secretary would call the secretaries of state and treasury, and cable Sherman Adams. Whitman&#x2019;s memory later was hazy; she thought she had called Milton first, then the other Eisenhower brothers, but Hagerty recorded in his diary that Ann had tearfully called him, relaying Mrs. Eisenhower&#x2019;s request that he be the one to contact the family.12<br> <br>Hagerty recalled that Foster Dulles &#x201c;was deeply shocked&#x201d; when he told the secretary of state of Eisenhower&#x2019;s condition. &#x201c;Jim, this is terrible news. It is terrible news for the President&#x2019;s family and for the country. But it is equally terrible for the free world.&#x201d; Dulles worried about the possibility that the nations of the world &#x201c;will adopt an attitude of waiting and seeing who will be the next President&#x201d; and decline to make commitments.<br> <br>Dulles had reason for concern. A foreign ministers meeting was scheduled in Geneva starting October 27, designed to follow up on the July meeting of American, British, French, and Soviet heads of state. Eisenhower&#x2019;s first summit with the Soviets had generated hope for progress toward peace, especially disarmament. Dulles feared that the president&#x2019;s illness would make the foreign ministers&#x2019; negotiations &#x201c;more difficult than ever&#x201d; and give the Soviets freedom &#x201c;to play the usual game of stalling.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hagerty&#x2019;s voice was &#x201c;choked up&#x201d; as he reached Milton Eisenhower on the phone. Milton suggested that, for public confidence, they bring in a civilian heart specialist, one not associated with the Army. Dr. Snyder and the Fitzsimons physicians had already reached the same conclusion and had settled on one of the leading cardiologists in America&#x2014;Paul Dudley White, the Boston specialist.13<br> <br>About 5:15 P.M., a frustrated Murray Snyder informed Hagerty that he had been instructed to remove the word &#x201c;mild&#x201d; from further announcements to the press. He and Hagerty groused about Dr. Snyder&#x2019;s messages, which had migrated from &#x201c;a mild digestion upset&#x201d; to &#x201c;a mild coronary thrombosis.&#x201d; Would the next message reveal something more serious? At Dr. Snyder&#x2019;s request, Hagerty arranged for Thomas W. Mattingly, the cardiologist at Walter Reed Hospital, to fly with him to Denver. Merriman Smith, the lead reporter with United Press International, had heard the news, called, and persuaded Hagerty to permit him to fly to Denver with them.14<br> <br>At ten minutes until eight o&#x2019;clock, Hagerty, Mattingly, and Smith boarded their plane. A torrential rainstorm at Lowry Air Force Base forced them to land at Stapleton Airport in Denver. Arriving at Fitzsimons about midnight, Hagerty quickly confirmed his worst fear&#x2014;the president&#x2019;s heart attack was &#x201c;more than mild.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ann Whitman, after a sleepless night, described Sunday, September 25, as &#x201c;a daze&#x2014;mostly telephoning.&#x201d; Hagerty, equally weary, arrived at the hospital at 6:30 A.M.

B. Sledge&#x2019;s critically acclaimed memoir, <i>With the Old Breed at Peleliu and Okinawa.</i> Picking up where his previous memoir leaves off, Sledge, a young marine in the First Division, traces his company&#x2019;s movements and charts his own difficult passage to peace following his horrific experiences in the Pacific. He reflects on his duty in the ancient city of Peiping (now Beijing) and recounts the difficulty of returning to his hometown of Mobile, Alabama, and resuming civilian life haunted by the shadows of close combat.<br><br> Distinguished historians have praised Sledge&#x2019;s first book as the definitive rifleman&#x2019;s account of World War II, ranking it with the Civil War&#x2019;s <i>Red Badge of Courage</i> and World War I&#x2019;s <i>All Quiet on the Western Front.</i> Although With the Old Breed ends with the surrender of Japan, marines in the Pacific were still faced with the mission of disarming the immense Japanese forces on the Asian mainland and reestablishing order. For infantrymen so long engaged in the savage and surreal world of close combat, there remained the personal tasks of regaining normalcy and dealing with suppressed memories, fears, and guilt. <br><br> In <i>China Marine</i>, E. B. Sledge completes his story and provides emotional closure to the searing events detailed in his first memoir. He speaks frankly about the real costs of war, emotional and psychological as well as physical, and explains the lifetime loyalties that develop between men who face fear, loss, and horror together. That bond becomes one of the newfound treasures of life after battle.<br><br> With his hallmark style of simplicity, directness, and lack of sentimentality, "Sledgehammer" has given us yet another great document of war literature.</p><p><b>Eugene Bondurant Sledge</b> was a US marine, professor of biology at the University of Montevallo, and author of <i>With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa</i>. His life and work were used as source material for Ken Burns's PBS documentary, &#x201c;The War.&#x201d;<br>The author of the classic World War II memoir <i>With the Old Breed</i> (1981) returns at last to relate the conclusion of his marine career. After the fighting stopped, Sledge went to China, where everybody and his faction from Szechwan was struggling to fill the power vacuum left by the Japanese surrender, and where armed Japanese awaiting repatriation were frequently vital to keeping order. Sledge's regiment was the first marine unit to return to Beijing, and he saw the last of the old China as well as the vanguard of the Communists. His local acquaintances were more numerous than the average marine's and included middle-class professionals, his houseboy, and a Belgian priest. While on duty he rescued Chinese staff from dogs and tried to rescue fellow marines from their alcoholism. He was finally released to go home, long after many rear-echelon types. He wraps up this book, a quite satisfactory conclusion to its thoroughly satisfactory predecessor, with a brief summary of his homecoming and postwar career as a professor of biology. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I write about it. I dream about it. I walk its streets and see something new each day - traces of faded lettering on the stone, still legible, but just; some facade that I have walked past before and not noticed; an unregarded doorway with the names, in brass, of those who lived there sixty years ago, the bell-pulls sometimes still in place, as if one might summon long-departed residents from their slumbers.&#34; Edinburgh is a city of stories - a place that has witnessed everything from great historical upheavals, to the individual lives of a remarkable cast of characters. Every spire, cobblestone, bridge, close and avenue has a tale to tell. In this sumptuous new book, Alexander McCall Smith curates his own, distinctive story of Edinburgh - combining his affectionate, incisive wit with a wealth of stunning imagery drawn from Scotland&#39;s national collection of architecture and archaeology. Through a series of photographs, maps, drawings and paintings - many never before published - he takes the reader on a unique tour. Just like the city&#39;s architecture, the book can move in an instant from sweeping views to secret, hidden vignettes. This is a story of famous landmarks and lost buildings; the people who made them; the people who lived in them. &#39;A Work of Beauty&#39; is an intimate portrait of a city by one of Scotland&#39;s greatest storytellers.</p><p>Alexander McCall Smith enjoyed a distinguished career as a Professor of Medical Law at the University of Edinburgh, before turning to writing full-time.

His uncompromising reviews avoid the familiar generalizations so often associated with artistic styles emerging during the 1950s and 60s. Here, Judd discusses in detail the work of more than 500 artists showing in New York at that time, and provides a critical account of this significant era in American art. While addressing the social and political ramifications of art production, the writings focus on the work of Jackson Pollock, Kazimir Malevich, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, John Chamberlain, Larry Poons, Kenneth Noland and Claes Oldenburg. His 1965 &#x201c;Specific Objects&#x201d; essay, a discussion of sculptural thought in the 60s, is included alongside the notorious polemical essay &#x201c;Imperialism, Nationalism, Regionalism&#x201d; and much else.</p><p>Perhaps more than any other artist of his generation, Judd shaped the cultural discourse of his time- not only through his radical sculptures, but with his prolific writing on his peers.

How, Tolstoy asks, does an unreflective man confront his one and only moment of truth? <br>This short novel was the artistic culmination of a profound spiritual crisis in Tolstoy's life, a nine-year period following the publication of Anna Karenina during which he wrote not a word of fiction.

They live in Leeds and have 3 grown up children. Janet s interest in cross-cultural issues began in childhood and developed into a focus on cross-cultural marriage whilst living outside the UK. She has spoken and written for many years on cross-cultural marriage.We hope you will get this book into the hands of anyone thinking about marriage, especially those going into international and cross cultural marriages. We have used this book in OM for many years to help prepare couples entering cross cultural marriages. Many couples dream of a life in missions together, but for many that dream does not come true. Financially, mission life is demanding. Often the couples have not counted the cost of the thousands of miles between their home countries where their parents and loved ones are and the cost of travel in visiting. When their mission dream collapses and they return, they sometimes have trouble finding a job or it is hard to re enter life at home and their church situation. Hearts break, marriages break and children are impacted. So you can understand why we believe this important book is a must read! --Dr George Verwer, Founder, Operation Mobilisation<br><br>Love Across Latitudes is more than an interesting book to be merely read and appreciated; rather, it is a valuable workbook that provides insightful discussion questions on varying life topics for people who are serious about understanding, overcoming and capitalizing on differences in culture and worldview. If you re looking for a practical resource that will enhance a bicultural relationship and help facilitate bridging any cultural divide, I highly recommend this time tested book. --Bob Sayer, Director of Arab World Initiatives for Pioneers USA<br><br>Marriage is one of God s most precious gifts. But it s also hard work. Cross cultural marriages can bring extra blessings and also extra challenges. Love Across Latitudes is a great resource to help couples, and the churches and communities who support them, to think through the blessings and challenges of cross cultural marriages. I m so pleased this book is being reprinted. Highly recommended. --Anna Bishop, Minister (World Mission), All Soul s, Langham Place, London</p><h2>Myths to Live By</h2><p>Examines the myth-making process since primitive times to demonstrate the ways in which specific myths reflect human needs</p><p>Joseph Campbell was an American author and teacher best known for his work in the field of comparative mythology.

But the war has taken its toll on the survivors, too. Consumed by the belief that the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress still lives, Obi-Wan Kenobi has temporarily forsaken his duties and recruited Anakin Skywalker in his desperate hunt for Ventress. But Anakin believes that Obi-Wan is chasing a ghost - because he himself killed Ventress. And Anakin&#39;s doubts about his former Master&#39;s quest are not assuaged when, following the trail of the rumors of Ventress&#39; existence, they walk into a trap set by their old enemies, the bounty hunter Durge and Count Dooku! A tale that tests the strengths of the bonds of brotherhood!</p><p>The seventh volume in Dark Horse's <i>Clone Wars</i> graphic-novel series collects the five-part miniseries <i>Obsession</i>, a title referring to Obi-Wan Kenobi and his refusal to believe that Count Dooku's assassin Asajj Ventress is truly dead. It's odd to have Anakin be the rational one, and the climactic showdowns, though exciting, have a sort of "all star" feel to them that make the story seem more like a stand-alone diversion rather than being tightly wound into the regular continuity of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe like most of the <i>Clone Wars</i> volumes. But even if <i>When They Were Brothers</i> doesn't quite measure up to that high standard, it still has the dynamic writing and art of <i>SW</i> veterans Hayden Blackman and Brian Ching. Filling out the volume is an Anakin/Obi-Wan story created for Free Comic Book Day 2005. <i>--David Horiuchi</i></p><h2>Lucky Bastard:: A Novel</h2><p>Lucky Bastard is the suspenseful and hilarious story of a gifted politician with dangerous friends and a zipper problem. The author is Charles McCarry, a writer widely acclaimed for his richly perceptive novels of political intrigue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> John Fitzgerald Adams, known by the voters who love him as Jack, has good reason to believe he is the illegitimate son of JFK. <br>His goal is the same as that of any Kennedy: to reclaim the presidency . . . and enjoy as many women as possible along the way. Jack possesses an instinctual political genius, an unerring knack for charming voters and advancing his own interests.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>But Jack, up from poverty, cannot make it to the Oval Office without money and support. Luckily, he becomes the beneficiary of the largesse of two maverick Russians who recognize Jack's talent and invest considerable resources in his rise to power. Jack also relies on a strong-willed wife, an ardent radical who masterminds his political moves while guarding against the threat that his wild libido will destroy his career. As Jack marches toward the presidency, others who realize the truth about his sinister connections try to stop him. But will anyone believe them?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Charles McCarry has long been recognized as the dean of Washington's novelists, "a magical writer, the very best in this field" (Martha Gellhorn, <br>Sunday Telegraph). With Lucky Bastard, McCarry has written the novel of his career, a thrilling and imaginative vision of power and conspiracy in the age of Clinton.</p><p>Task: Concoct a plot for a novel about a draft-dodging president with a ready smile and a readier libido; a staunchly feminist, Ivy League-educated First Lady; and a political campaign funded by the suspiciously manipulable accounts of a Midwestern bank.<p> Result: <i>Primary Colors</i>? Perhaps. Or you might barely have scratched the surface of Charles McCarry's darkly byzantine and wildly perceptive new novel, <i>Lucky Bastard</i>. McCarry rips the skeletons from Clinton's wide-open closet and clothes them with the slightly tattered grandeur of Camelot: his hero is John Fitzgerald Adams ("Jack"), who possesses an instinctual political genius and an unerring knack for charming voters while advancing his own interests. Jack also happens to believe that he is JFK's illegitimate son, and his march to the White House carries the aura of "divine right."</p><p> Or is that Left? McCarry spins a labyrinthine tale of political influence driven by two maverick Russians who believe that the Communist Revolution "happened in the wrong country at the wrong time." They recognize Jack's talent and charisma and sponsor his rise to power in the hope of achieving tradecraft's coup de gr�ce: a Soviet pawn in the Oval Office.</p><p> Perhaps the novel's greatest strength is its narrator, Dmitri, a cynical Russian whose dry wit and world-weary observations anchor the unabashedly excessive (and usually lubricious) machinations of agents, handlers, recruits, and just plain folks. Thanks mostly to Dmitri, you may never again watch the evening news without a raised eyebrow and a "What if...?" on your lips. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>"Charles McCarry is a fascinating and vigorous storyteller, and I really enjoyed reading Lucky Bastard. This is not your usual thriller. <br>McCarry has wonderful insight into the political process and the psychology of politicians."<br>--Mario Puzo<br><br>"Charles McCarry at his best is the best there is, and Lucky Bastard is Charles McCarry at his best."<br>--Peter Benchley<br><br>"No one understands Washington--its secrets, its politics, its plumbing--like Charles McCarry."<br>--Paul Theroux<br><br>"Charles McCarry is not only one of the best writers in America but one of the most important."<br>--Christopher Buckley<br><br>"Charles McCarry is the Lord's best combination of spellbinding storyteller and silken prose writer.

His chasm theory describes how high-tech products initially sell well, mainly to a technically literate customer base, but then hit a lull as marketing professionals try to cross the chasm to mainstream buyers. This pattern, says Moore, is unique to the high-tech industry.<p> Moore suggests remedies for the problem that can help businesses meet their long-term goals. He coaches marketing professionals on how to move slowly through the gulf, teaching them to create profiles and target specific segments of the population rather than trying to plow right into the mainstream. He cites examples of successful chasm crossings by such companies as Apple, Tandem, Oracle, and Sun, showing what they all had in common and exposing the different weaknesses in their strategies. Moore also assigns responsibility for success to programmers and developers by suggesting they design a "whole product model." Here, because integration tasks are daunting to the mainstream market, all the components of a technological product must be in one package. Moore also describes strategies for competing with rival companies and assessing the best distribution channels for penetrating the target market.</p><p> Written not just for marketing specialists but for all employees whose futures ride on the success of a technical product, <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> delivers crucial information in an engaging, readable tone.</p>Geoffrey A.

When Gideon and his wife, Julie, arrive to study some old bones, some recent remains make their appearance. A freelance reporter who is writing a sensational series on the dig and the theft is shot.

In the past, his far-flung expeditions have been dismissed as little more than tourist jaunts. But with this book-the first significant study of the figures and landscapes that Sargent painted from 1900 (after he had established himself as one of the foremost portraitists of the age) through 1914 (when World War I changed his world)-it becomes clear that his travel paintings constitute a far larger and more important aspect of his work than previously realized. Many of these oils and watercolors come from private collections and have rarely, if ever, been seen in the years since the artist's death in 1925.<br>Three of the book's five chapters approach Sargent's paintings thematically, investigating the work he produced in the Alps, around the Mediterranean, and in Venice; as these enlightening essays make clear, each locale inspired a distinctive response from the artist. In the mountains he painted bubbling streams, distant views, and languorous girls in alpine meadows. In the south, he painted fruits and flowers, fragments of architecture, and villas and gardens that are dreamlike in their evocation of the past. The first essay provides a useful background to Sargent's preoccupation with landscape subjects after 1900 and traces the broad development of his style and the major influences on his work. The final essay recounts the diverse critical responses to Sargent's plein-air painting during his lifetime.<br>For the first time, Sargent's extensive travels are thoroughly documented here, using letters and diaries written by his companions. Charming vintage photographs, including some that Sargent is believed to have taken himself, chronicle his adventures and cast new light on this intensely private artist. The book also includes an invaluable chronology of the artist's travels as well as brief biographies of his traveling companions-mostly beloved family and dear friends-who accompanied Sargent on his creative journeys.</p><p>Warren Adelson (president of Adelson Galleries, New York) is founder and supporter of the ongoing Sargent catalogue raisonne project.

None of his chief biographers--Evan Charteris, Charles Merrill Mount, Stanley Olson--devotes more than four pages to the story of his painting expeditions abroad. This study, the first serious examination of the landscapes and figure subjects painted by Sargent between 1900 and 1914, will correct that misconception. The scarce biographical data on this aspect of Sargent's work might suggest that Sargentconsidered landscape painting to be a secondary activity, something to pass the time while relaxing on holiday, but this is contradicted by the evidence of the paintings themselves. The body of landscape work is formidable in its range and quality, showing that Sargent pursued landscape themes with the same intensity and inventivenessevident in his portraits and murals. He did not paint because he went abroad; he went abroad to paint. </p><p>Sargent had exhibited portraits and figure subjects in equal measure at the Salon during his early career. In England he became almost exclusively an Impressionist for a period of three or four years in the late 1880s. And in the following decade, the portraitist turned muralist, reverting to the older academic tradition in which he had been reared. It should come as no surprise, therefore, to find Sargent reengineering himself in the early 1900s, especially when he had, by then, achieved a measure of financial independence.His vision was not that of a tourist casually recording what happened to catch his eye but of an explorer in search of new prospects and ideas. </p><p>The essays and plates in this study demonstrate that Sargent was preoccupied by particular themes and motifs throughout the early 1900s. In this way it is possible to evaluate the large body of work previously regarded as simply descriptions of his travels and prove that he was, in fact, much more deliberate, even obsessive, in what he chose to paint than has been previously recognized. Sargent's themes cross over individual expeditions and places to reveal a coherent artistic vision. This has guided ourdecision to analyze Sargent's work thematically rather than chronologically. The broad geographical boundaries of the Alps, the Mediterranean, and Venice provide a framework that is not intended to be exclusive; there are many parallels and similarities to be drawn between his subject types regardless of topography and climate. In the mountains he painted beautiful girls in alpine meadows, bubbling streams, and distant views. In Italy he painted fragments of architecture seen close up, villas and gardens that are dreamlike in their evocation of the past, traditional sailing ships and boats, white Siena oxen and mules, peasants in the fields, fruit, and flowers. Venice is something ofa special case, because the city is unique and because Sargent's infatuation with its canals and palaces and its translucent qualities of light lasted for so many years. </p><p>This book's five essays identify the main strands in Sargent's landscape work between 1900 and 1914. (Because of the volume of work he produced in those years, we have notattempted to widen the study beyond those dates.) The illustrations demonstrate the persistence of certain motifs in a powerful visual form, forming a vivid record of the obsessional nature of Sargent's landscape work. The first essay provides the background to Sargent's preoccupation with landscape subjects after 1900 and traces the broad development of his style and the major influences on his work. The next three essays break down his landscapes and subject pictures into constituent themes. In this way we build up a composite picture of his output by concentrating on groups of works that show him returning to subjects over the years. The fifth essay addresses the reputationof Sargent's outdoor painting. In addition, there are a supporting chronology and a dramatis personae of the many travel companions-artists, friends, and family-whoaccompanied Sargent on his journeys. These essays and Sargent's remarkable visual accounts will surely inspire further studies in the years ahead.</p></p><h2>The Vulture Fund</h2><p>The author of the best-selling The Takeover presents a novel of deadly duplicity on Wall Street, featuring a young investment wizard who discovers political corruption behind a multi-billion-dollar deal.

(Favor of God)</h2><p>The revelation inside the pages of this book is life transforming. Until God gave me this revelation, I had no idea that Scriptures I had circled even as a child would have special significance in the years to come. After having see Jesus face-to-face at the age of eleven, I knew I wanted to hear His voice again. That is what sparked this amazing search. I learned through this revelation how to hear the voice of God again and again-through His Word. As a little boy who desperately wanted approval, and was accustomed to nothing but rejection, I could very easily have lived my life compromising to gain acceptance. But this revelation has kept me from doing that. Instead, I have sought Divine affirmation - to turn my equity into currency, and my influence into favor. The thing that frightened me most was not that I was inadequate, but that I felt with my whole heart that I was called to manifest the light of God. I realized that staying small would not serve my world. Shrinking to accommodate my critics would not transform the world around me. The words of the prophet Jeremiah cried out to me: &#34;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations.&#34; May the Spirit of God open your eyes to this revelation! Once you get it, you will refuse to be obsessed with what you&#39;re going through; you will be obsessed with what you are going to.</p><p></p><h2>Sew Any Fabric: A Quick Reference to Fabrics from A to Z</h2><p><p><b>Fabric Basics at Your Fingertips</b></p><p>Have you ever wished you could call an expert and ask for a five-minute explanation on the particulars of a fabric you are sewing?<b>Claire Shaeffer</b> provides this key information for 88 of today's most popular fabrics.

The narrative includes copious commentary by most of the major players associated with the integration of baseball and the Dodgers' winning of their first-ever World Series. Raymond Todd tells the story well. Without much vocal dramatizing he puts the listener in the middle of Irish-Italian-Jewish Brooklyn and creates a range of voices that move the narrative forward. Each voice is immediately identifiable and convincing. An interesting listen for fans of baseball history.

In fact one wonders why the Air Corps elected to give the H-75P a designation other than a dash number in the P-36 series since it was basically a re-engined P-36A. Spin-offs from the P-36 design would result not only in the P-40 but the XP-37, XP-42, XP-46, XP-53, XP-60, and XP-62 plus the ones given Y designations and various dash numbers.</p> <p>Ignoring the Curtiss Hawk biplanes, the family tree of the P-40 would seem to have its tap roots in the XP-934 Curtiss Swift of 1932 vintage. Although some experience in the low-wing monoplane type was gained when the company produced its famed Shrike series of attack planes, the Swift, or XP-31 as it was designated by the Air Corps, was their first low-wing pursuit design. By one of those odd quirks, the Swift initially was powered by an in-line engine which gave way to a more powerful radial, just the reverse of the P-36 to P-40 design development. The XP-31 was not successful with either engine and the design was soon abandoned (It did earn the dubious distinction of being the last U.S. pursuit plane with a fixed landing gear). The Curtiss Company's fortunes took a downward turn in the pursuit field when the Boeing P-26A was selected by the Air Corps over the XP-31.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Memory Wars: Freud&#39;s Legacy in Dispute</h2><p>The author&#39;s critique of Freudian psychoanalyis and the &#34;recovered memory&#34; movement, first published in 1993 in The New York Review of Books to a storm of controversy, is presented along with twenty-five responses. IP.</p><p>This volume collects Frederick Crews's two controversial essays on Freud from the <i>New York Review of Books</i>, "The Unknown Freud" and "The Revenge of the Repressed," as well as some of the critical letters provoked by their original publication in 1993 and 1994. In these essays, Crews elaborates upon his belief that "the relatively patent and vulgar pseudoscience of recovered memory rests in appreciable measure on the respectable and entrenched pseudoscience of psychoanalysis." Recovered memory therapy, according to his thesis, is a grossly negative practice that, in turn, has its origins in Freudian assumptions about psychoanalysis--assumptions that Crews charges were based on fraudulent data and intellectual bullying. As the reader responses indicate, these ideas were like a grenade tossed into the center of psychoanalytic culture, made all the more powerful by Crews's lively prose.Crews mounts a slashing critique of Sigmund Freud's mistaken diagnoses, sexist hectoring of patients, exaggeration of results, equivocation and attempts to cover up therapeutic disasters. According to this distinguished critic and professor emeritus (UC Berkeley), Freud ascribed to some patients repressed oedipal sexual desires after he had unsuccessfully goaded them to remember childhood incest or molestation. Furthermore, Crews maintains, Freud in 1905 retroactively changed the alleged seducers of infants to fathers, whereas in his reports of the previous decade, they were said to have been siblings, strangers, teachers, governesses. Freud's brainchild, psychoanalysis, was and remains a pseudoscience, in Crews's estimate. Its offspring, he asserts, is today's recovered-memory movement, which he believes is deluding countless patients, mostly women, into leveling false charges of sexual abuse based on supposedly recovered memories that, in Crews's opinion, are often manufactured through overzealous or incompetent therapists' suggestions. This volume contains three articles that Crews published in the New York Review of Books in 1993 and 1994, together with his fiercely contentious exchanges with 19 letter-writers, mostly psychoanalysts, who challenged his views. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Seth Eastman: A Portfolio of North American Indians</h2><p>The foremost pictorial historian of the American Indian in the nineteenth century, Seth Eastman was a career army officer and talented artist widely appreciated today for his ethnographic detail. Assigned to frontier duty, including a seven-year stint at Fort Snelling in the 1840s, Eastman set out to preserve a visual record of Indian life which was then undergoing rapid change.<br>Enabled by his long-term military residency among the Indians to become familiar not only with their colorful external trappings but with the whole complex fabric of Indian culture, Eastman painted all of the commonplace activities of everyday Indian life. His portfolio included scenes of winter villages and temporary summer encampments; courting and marriage customs; Indians making maple sugar, protecting their cornfields from birds, spearing fish, and gathering wild rice; the menstrual lodge, the manner in which Dakota women sat, and the medicine man with a patient; and the breaking up of camp and Indians traveling.<br>The Hill Collection contains fifty-six paintings the artist prepared mainly for Henry Rowe Schoolcraft's monumental six-volume work, Information Regarding the History, Condition and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States (1851-1857).</p><p>This book about Indians is also the story of watercolorist Seth Eastman (1808^-75) and industrialist James J. Hill (1838^-1916). Assigned to Fort Snelling on what, in the early 1800s, was the frontier, Eastman captured the daily lives of the Ojibway and Dakota peoples in expressive works on paper that Hill later collected and housed in the library he established in St. Paul. The accompanying essays concentrate on the two white men, but the book's reproductions constitute an entirely different work. In them we see not the romanticizations of Indian life so many artists of the period give us, but the real lives of those people as they gather rice, fish through the ice, mourn their dead, and heal their sick. The drawing of a young woman serenely sitting, in the distinctively modest way of Ojibway women of the era, in the shade of a menstrual lodge while her village bustles in the background exemplifies the precious documentation Eastman made. Pleasingly composed and delicately colored, Eastman's works emphasize the ways of a people whose collective life would soon be radically changed. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i></p><h2>Paintings that Changed the World: From Lascoux to Picasso</h2><p>Looking at 90 of history&#39;s greatest masterpieces to explain just what makes them great, this work contains brief, informative essays that examine each work from historic and cultural perspectives and offers intriguing observations and interesting anecdotes about the artists and their eras.

Sent at a young age to live with her grandmother in Arkansas, Angelou learned a great deal from this exceptional woman and the tightly knit black community there. These very lessons carried her throughout the hardships she endured later in life, including a tragic occurrence while visiting her mother in St. Louis and her formative years spent in California--where an unwanted pregnancy changed her life forever. Marvelously told, with Angelou&#39;s &#34;gift for language and observation,&#34; this &#34;remarkable autobiography by an equally remarkable black woman from Arkansas captures, indelibly, a world of which most Americans are shamefully ignorant.&#34;"This testimony from a black sister marks the beginning of a new era in the minds and hearts of all black men and women... <i>I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings</i>, liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity. I have no words for this achievement, but I know that not since the days of my childhood, when the people in books were more real than the people one saw every day, have I found myself so moved... Her portrait is a biblical study in life in the midst of death." -- James Baldwin <p>"Simultaneously touching and comic" -- <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>"It is a heroic and beautiful book." -- <i>Clevland Plain Dealer</i></p><p>"Maya Angelou is a natural writer with an inordinate sense of life and she has written and exceptional autobiographical narrative... a beautiful book -- an unconditionally involving memoir for our time or any time." -- <i>The Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>Learning How to Learn: Psychology and Spirituality in the Sufi Way</h2><p>In this ideal introduction to Sufi wisdom, Shah illustrates how traditional Sufi concepts can resolve our social, psychological, and spiritual problems, drawing on classic texts, the Eastem parables of Jesus, and encounters with contemporary teachers, students, and journalists.</p><p>Doris Lessing, whose many writings include <i>The Golden Notebook</i>, has received numerous awards, including Spain's Prince of Asturias Prize.<p>Virtually all organizations known to you work largely by means of your greed.

Awakening to the Dream</i> is a book about you and your true identity.</b></p><p><i>Awakening to the Dream</i> is a very clear, approachable overview of the enigmatic philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, also known as non duality. Essentially, this is a book about you. It points to and from the source of your true identity. The clear seeing that it refers to is neither complex nor simple. It is not something exclusive for intellectual or spiritual elite, nor is it remote or hiding in the future. It is all inclusive, pure presence, closer than your breath. It is the heart of hearts, your birthright and innermost self. This is your invitation to remember what was never really forgotten.</p></p><p><b>Leo Hartong</b> lives and works in the Netherlands. Life is his study and teacher. He has tried many roles and is currently simply sharing in, and pointing to, <i>what is</i>.Random Excerpts chosen by Christiana Duranczyk <p>Christiana is an editor for the NDhighlights news letter from the Nonduality Salon </p><p>The mind not only appears in Awareness, it tends to confuse its own intellectual activity with Awareness. In fact, Awareness is not a product of the mind, but the mind is a product of Awareness- the silent and permanent background common to everything, including the mind and its activity. Like the screen on which we watch a movie, this background is generally ignored in favor of the impermanent activity that appears on or against it. Zoom out, and Awareness and its content unify in a Self-luminous singularity about which nothing can be said or known for the simple reason that anything said or known is part-and-parcel of this singularity. p. 40 </p><p>Awareness is the consistent characteristic in and behind all experience, yet it is also that which most easily escapes our attention. Attention is not the same as Awareness. Our brain is designed in such a way that giving attention to something automatically implies ignoring something else. We see the stars and ignore the space; we read this text and ignore the page; we see the movie and ignore the screen; yet it is obvious that the ignored space, page, and screen are as fundamental to our observations as the stars, the text, and the movie, which hold our attention. This is an important point, as the mechanics of attention often get confused with Awareness. Attention works through noticing something in contrast to something that's ignored, while Awareness is the non-dual space that sustains both the noticed and the ignored. Attention may require effort; Awareness simply is. Everything that comes up is contained in and embraced by this Awareness, including objects perceived as "out there" (rocks, cars, other sentient beings) and emotions, thoughts, and feelings experienced as "in here." In this sense, Awareness is as much in the body-mind as the body-mind is in Awareness. Compare it to a clay pot, which contains space and at the same time is contained by space. Breaking the pot will not affect this space. p. 61 </p><p>Another way of seeing this is to follow your path backward. Instead of going after the realization you want, look to where the want arises; then take another step back and observe from where the "I" arises. What is the silence before the "I"? What is this no-thing-ness, this absolute presence? Does it strive to get something or somewhere? Does it need to become something, or does all becoming arise from and in it? p. 82 </p><p>It is the sort of experience that people who want enlightenment are looking for; and many have confused it with enlightenment, as did I. What is generally overlooked, however, is the silent background in which both the experience and the "I" that remembers and interprets it occur. To this mirror-like Awareness, such an experience is simply another cloud drifting by. </p><p>The silent background in which experience appears and disappears had escaped the attention of the "me" that thought he "got it." p. 103 </p><p>This vibrant, pulsating display of energy has no purpose beyond itself, and in this very purposelessness lies its infinite delight. To the one hearing this music, it extends an open invitation to realize the ever-present flow that is going on, to simply go with it and surrender to its causeless joy. When this invitation is accepted, it becomes plain as the nose on your face that any step taken to get closer to one's true Self is one step too many. p. 116 </p><p>The truth is, of course, not in these words but in the understanding of them. If you really hear, you're really here, and you encounter the answer everywhere. It is repeated in and as everything and says again and again, "All is One. This is IT. You are IT." p. 135 </p><p>If no answer or concept can jolt you from your sense of separation, if you have reached a dead end in your search, perhaps it is possible to disregard all concepts, to simply surrender to what is and stand naked and alone as this. Perhaps you can stop waiting for an event to confirm that you are fully awake and simply accept that it must be already so. To accept that there is no separate you, and therefore no one in need of waking up, is a shortcut. You might call it the final "stepless step." Rip off all the labels, ignore the ever-changing stories in your head, and see what remains unchanged. p. 136</p></p><h2>Murder Machine: A True Story of Murder, Madness &amp; the Mafia</h2><p>A gritty expose+a7 of organized crime focuses on Roy DeMeo, a professional hit man whose team of contract killers caused even the Gambino crime family to tremble.

New York Daily News reporters Mustain and Capeci (coauthors, Mob Star, 1989--not reviewed) tell the fascinating and repellently detailed story of Roy DeMeo and the gang he raised from teenagers in Canarsie--a Brooklyn neighborhood where death by natural causes is ``six bullets in the head,'' according to one cop. The middle-class DeMeo, a natural criminal, was carrying cash in brown paper bags and driving a Cadillac by his high- school senior year. After establishing loan-sharking headquarters at his Gemini Lounge in Brooklyn, he shipped scores of stolen luxury cars to Kuwait, distributed drugs (one of his crew was the chief supplier of cocaine at Studio 54), and wholesaled child pornography. When the inevitable business disputes arose, his crew simply made the other parties disappear. The victims were lured into a clubhouse behind the Gemini Lounge, where they were shot and dismembered (``it's just like takin' apart a deer''), then secured in Hefty Bags and tossed on the Canarsie dump. One murder led so easily to another that soon the ``Gemini method'' was used on anybody who got in the gang's way or annoyed them. DeMeo presented three of his coke-crazed crew with sets of custom carving knives, which they kept in their car trunks in case a quick assignment arose. When a special NYPD/FBI task force cracked the DeMeo gang, it tagged the criminals for 75 murders. DeMeo (who was rubbed out by fellow mobsters as the cops closed in) bragged of one hundred personally, making him far more destructive than any known US serial killer.

Julie has returned to her family, but her wolf pack has a story all its own. Fearless but inexperienced Kapu is now the new leader of the pack. He must protect his wolves from the threats of famine and disease and, at the same time, defend himself from bitter rivals, both inside and outside the pack, who are waiting for their chance to overthrow him. The strength of Kapu's leadership will determine not just the well-being of the pack but its very survival.<p> Jean Craighead George's research and first-hand observation form this engrossing, epic tale that's sure to draw readers into the fascinating world of wolves.</p></p><p>Born in Washington, D.C. and raised in a family of naturalists, Jean George has centered her life around writing and nature. She attended Pennsylvania State University, graduating with degrees in English and science. In the 1940s she was a member of the White House press corps and a reporter for the <i>Washington Post.</i> Ms. George, who has written over 90 books - among them <i>My Side of the Mountain</i> (Dutton), a 1960 Newbery Honor Book, and its sequels <i>On the Far Side of the Mountain</i> and <i>Frightful's Mountain</i> (both Dutton) - also hikes, canoes, and makes sourdough pancakes. In 1991, Ms. George became the first winner of the School Library Media Section of the New York Library Association's Knickerbocker Award for Juvenile Literature, which was presented to her for the "consistent superior quality" of her literary works.<p>Her inspiration for the Newbery Medal-winning <i>Julie of the Wolves</i> evolved from two specific events during a summer she spent studying wolves and tundra at the Arctic Research Laboratory of Barrow, Alaska: "One was a small girl walking the vast ad lonesome tundra outside of Barrow; the other was a magnificent alpha male wolf, leader of a pack in Denali National Park ... They haunted me for a year or more, as did the words of one of the scientists at the lab: 'If there ever was any doubt in my mind that a man could live with the wolves, it is gone now. The wolves are truly gentlemen, highly social and affectionate.'"</p><p>The mother of three children, Jean George is a grandmother who has joyfully red to her grandchildren since they were born. Over the years Jean George has kept 173 pets, not including dogs and cats, in her home in Chappaqua, New York. "Most of these wild animals depart in autumn, when the sun changes their behavior and they feel the urge to migrate or go off alone. While they are with us, however, they become characters in my books, articles, and stories."</p><br><br>The wolves of the Avalik River ran in and out among the musk oxen. Their ruffs rippled like banners. Ice crystals danced up from their feet. The pack swirled like a twist of wind-blown snow. Their yellow eyes flashed and dimmed in the coming and going of the ice mist. Like the snow, they made no sound.<br>The musk oxen stopped and stared at the enemy. Then they lowered their shaggy heads and pawed down to the new grass growing under the snow. Their breath rose in steamy clouds and froze on their brows.<br>Kapu, the young leader of the wolf pack, reared on his hind legs, leaped to point the way, and led his clan to a turquoise-blue rise on the treeless Arctic tundra.<br>He carried himself proudly, with his chest forward and his head high. His black fur was brushed to a shine by the wind. His body was strongly muscled. He was the leader of the wolf pack that had saved the life of the young Eskimo girl, Miyax--whose English name was Julie Edwards--when she was lost on the Arctic tundra. She, in turn, had saved them by leading them to a new food source during the great caribou famine. The Yupik and Inupiat Eskimos of Kangik called them "Julie's wolf pack."<br>Kapu was keenly aware of Julie. She was not far away. He whisked his tail. She had read his message to the oxen, for she was no longer afraid that he would kill one. The villagers collected the wool from these sturdy animals to weave into light, warm clothing, and they zealously protected them.<br>"We are not hunting you," Kapu had said to the oxen with his body movements. "We chase you for the joy of it. We are wolves of the caribou."<br>Kapu and his followers were having fun. The shaggy herd deciphered this and returned to their grazing. Julie deciphered it and told her father, <br>Kapugen. He chuckled and slipped his arm around her shoulders. The two walked quietly home.<br>Kapu wagged his tail. Chasing the oxen was a fine wolf joke. His rime-gray mate, Aaka, playfully spanked the ground with her forepaws, her rear end in the air. Zing--the beta, or second in command--enjoyed the joke even more than Kapu. His breathing came faster, and the pupils of his eyes enlarged ever so slightly. He smiled by lifting his lips from his glistening teeth. Pearly-white Silver, Kapu's mother, and her ill-tempered new mate, Raw Bones, also smiled. But Amy, Kapu's night-black daughter, did not get the joke. She was not old enough to know that her pack preferred caribou to musk oxen. Nor did she know that some packs harvest only deer and ignore moose, or harvest moose and caribou and ignore deer. Others take elk; a few take musk oxen. When the Avalik River Pack had a choice, they were wolves of the caribou. Wolves have their cultures.<br>The adolescent Amy studied the curled horns and bony brows of the musk oxen, then looked at her regal father. If he thought the chase was fun, then she did, too. She wagged her tail.<br>Amy could not possibly know that her pack were caribou wolves. She had been born in a caribou famine. These big Arctic deer had failed to come to Avalik territory for many years. The pack had taken what food they could find--a musk ox killed by a grizzly bear, rabbits, lemmings. Late in the fall they were able to add an occasional moose to their diet, but by March of her first year Amy's pack was starving again. The moose were gone. The wolves grew thin. They tired easily. When the breeding season arrived that month, her parents did not mate. Aaka, her mother, was undernourished. There had not been enough food for her to develop healthy puppies.<br>The rangy, self-important Raw Bones knew well that the pack had not had enough to eat for years. Nevertheless, he approached Silver to start their family. Kapu rushed to him. Hair rising on his back, ears erect and pointed forward, Kapu talked to him in the wolf language of posturing. Then he lifted his head above him and rumbled a dark authoritative growl that said plainly, "No pups." It is inherent in the leader of the wolf pack that he uses his judgment and makes such a decision. Raw Bones ignored him. He stepped closer to Silver.<br>Kapu bared his teeth and drew the corners of his mouth forward. His forehead wrinkled.<br>Raw Bones challenged this reprimand with a jaw snap. Kapu grabbed the back of his neck but did not clamp down with his bone-crushing jaws. He did not need to. He was saying, "I am the leader. No pups." Raw Bones drew his ears back and close to his head. He pulled his tail between his legs and lowered his body. This posture said, "You are the leader. I submit to you."<br>Obediently Raw Bones slunk off to the edge of the pack in the manner of a chastised wolf citizen. But he did not mean it.<br>He glanced back to see if Kapu was looking at him. If not, he would sneak-attack him. Kapu was looking. He displayed one canine tooth. It shone lethal white against the black of his lips. "Don't dare," it said. Raw Bones lay down. Rumbling sounds of peevishness rolled in his chest. He did not like being dominated, especially by a younger male.<br>Kapu did not completely relax. Raw Bones was his rival. He wanted to be leader of the Avaliks, Kapu's pack. He had been alpha male wolf of the Upper Colville River Pack for many years. Then the famine struck. One by one the members of his pack starved to death until he was the only one left alive. When his new mate, Silver, joined him, they survived on rabbits and other small mammals and waited for the famine to end and the feasting to begin.</p><h2>Creaturepedia: Welcome to the Greatest Show on Earth</h2><p><p>Welcome to this collection of best-loved animals from all over the world, chosen for their special talents and characteristics, with fun illustrations by Adrienne Barman.

The text is accompanied by a wide range of illustrations.</p><p>Delia Smith is Britain's bestselling cookery writer, whose books have sold over 21 million copies worldwide. Delia's first job as a cookery writer was for the Daily Mirror in 1969 - numerous phenomenal best sellers and television series followed including Delia Smith's Complete Cookery Course in 1978 and Delia's Christmas, Summer &amp; Winter Collections in the 1990s. Towards the end of the decade Delia commenced work on a new major project - Delia's How to Cook, publishing three separate volumes and the accompanying TV series. The Vegetarian Collection and The Delia Collection followed. After a five year break concentrating on Norwich City Football Club (where she is a director) and Canary Catering, Delia returned triumphant in 2008 with a new BBC TV series and the fastest selling cookery book of all time 'Delia's How to Cheat at Cooking' - which has sold over 800,000 copies. Delia is married to the writer and editor, Michael Wynn Jones. They live in Suffolk.A friendly, encouraging tone and kitchen expressions from across the pond mark this comprehensive revision of British authority Smith's Complete Cookery Course , first seen 20 years ago. Predictable variations on American norms, such as measuring ingredients by weight rather than volume, and a full chapter devoted to ``offal'' seem to go hand in hand with vocabulary differences (a ``liquidiser'' is a blender; ``pulses'' are beans, peas and lentils) and unexpected organizational approaches, as in the chapter ``Pasta and Pancakes.'' A generally looser sense of categorization is represented in the chapter ``Cheese,'' which includes a reference page describing traditional English Derbyshire, Stilton and Cheshire; recipes for Greek salad; pizza; ``fillets'' of sole gratinee; and gnocchi, along with souffles and cheese tarts. American cooks may miss balsamic vinegar, tropical fruits and exotic vegetables and question the emphasis on heavy cream, butter and lard. But Smith's streamlined lists of ingredients and her chatty instructions lend an appealing air to basic, unexceptional recipes.

But when the two biggest newspaper publishers, Hearst and Pulitzer, raise the wholesale price that Finn and his friends pay for the papers they sell, the boys band together and go on strike. Susan Campbell Bartoletti brings humor and wit to this classic David and Goliath struggle between the Newsies and the newspaper publishers.</p><p>SUSAN CAMPBELL BARTOLETTI&#39;s Hitler Youth was named a Newbery Honor Book, and Black Potatoes: The Story of the Great Irish Famine, 1845-1850 was awarded the Robert F. Sibert Medal. Ms. Bartoletti lives with her family in Moscow, Pennsylvania.Grade 4-6-Finn's Irish family embodies many of the hopes and dreams of immigrants as they endure the setbacks and challenges of poverty. Finn's desire to become a reporter does not extend to enjoying school, just as his father's aspirations for wealth sometimes lead him outside the law. The 13-year-old's buddies, Racetrack and Mush, are also newsies and, along with Grandpa Jiggsy, keep things humming. Bartoletti's engaging style using slang (heavy use of "my arse" throughout) and the family's Irish background help the story to become much more than a recitation of historical facts. This story of life as a newsie, hawking papers on the streets of New York, is a standout in the series. The book includes an imagined epilogue that continues the deception that this is a real diary, and a historical note provides the accurate context with numerous photographs. For fans of the series, this title will be a highlight-it's entertaining and the characters leap off the pages.<br><i>Carol A.

He sent his journals, a novel-in-progess, and copies of all his poems to his mentor, Columbia professor Mark Van Doren, for safe keeping, fully expecting to write little, if anything, ever again.&nbsp; It was a relatively short-lived resolution, for Merton almost immediately found himself being assigned writing tasks by his Abbot&#x2014;one of which was the autobiographical essay that blossomed into his international best-seller <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>. That book made him famous overnight, and for a time he struggled with the notion that the vocation of the monk and the vocation of the writer were incompatible. Monasticism called for complete surrender to the absolute, whereas writing demanded a tactical withdrawal from experience in order to record it.&nbsp; He eventually came to accept his dual vocation as two sides of the same spiritual coin and used it as a source of creative tension the rest of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Merton&#x2019;s thoughts on writing have never been compiled into a single volume until now. Robert Inchausti has mined the vast Merton literature to discover what he had to say on a whole spectrum of literary topics, including writing as a spiritual calling, the role of the Christian writer in a secular society, the joys and mysteries of poetry, and evaluations of his own literary work. Also included are fascinating glimpses of his take on a range of other writers, including Henry David Thoreau, Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, Dylan Thomas, Albert Camus, James Joyce, and even Henry Miller, along with many others.</p></p><p>Thomas Merton (1915&#x2013;1968) was a Trappist monk, spiritual director, political activist, social critic, and one of the most-read spiritual writers of the twentieth century. He is the author of many books, including <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>.&#x201c;&#x2018;For me to be a saint means to be myself,&#x2019; wrote Thomas Merton. And for Merton, to be himself meant being not only a monk, but a writer as well. Few contemporary writers have pondered so deeply the idea of writing as a vocation. Fewer still have meditated on the complex interplay between writing and faith. In this marvelous collection of excerpts from Merton&#x2019;s books, essays, journals, and letters, readers will discover how a vocation, if fully embraced, can lead to both joy for oneself and joy for the world."&#x2014;James Martin, SJ, Associate Editor, America, author of <i>My Life with the Saints</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Thomas Merton is one of the most widely read and influential authors of the twentieth century, yet no one was more conscious of the spiritual pitfalls that the writer may fall into or the limitations of language. Anyone drawn to the vocation of writing will be grateful to Robert Inchausti for gathering together in one volume what Merton has to say about being a writer.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jim Forest, author of <i>Living with Wisdom: A Biography of Thomas Merton</i> <p></p></p><h2>The Holy Bible: Containing the Old and New Testaments, King James Version</h2><p>Translated out of the original tongues with former translations diligently compared and revised.

Since its 1918 debut, generations of hungry readers have been helping themselves to <i>The Magic Pudding</i>. A walking, talking dessert, the pudding shares its deliciousness with everyone and never runs out &#x2014; because it's magic!<br>Australian author and artist Norman Lindsay wrote this jolly fable in response to a friend who claimed that children liked to read about fairies. Lindsay maintained that kids prefer food and fighting, and this fun-filled romp abounds in both. Sailor Bill and his companions Bunyip Bluegum (a koala) and Sam Sawnoff (a penguin) stroll, eat, and defend the pudding from would-be thieves. Upon occasion, the friends burst into exuberant song, punctuating their adventures with a series of whimsical rhymes. Charmingly illustrated by the author, this children's classic promises to satisfy even the biggest appetite. "Hearty eaters," as Sam remarks, "are always welcome."</p><p>"This is the funniest children&#x2019;s book ever written. I&#x2019;ve been laughing at it for fifty years, and when I read it again this morning, I laughed just as much as I ever did. There&#x2019;s no point in trying to explain why it&#x2019;s funny. If there&#x2019;s anyone so bereft of humour that they can read these words and look at these pictures without laughing, then heaven help them, because they&#x2019;re beyond the reach of advice, instruction or despair." --Philip Pullman, from the introductionNorman Lindsay (1879-1969) was born in Victoria, Australia, the fifth of ten children, several of whom grew up to be artists. At age seventeen, he left home and traveled to Melbourne, where he found work as an illustrator. Famously prolific in many mediums, Lindsay produced countless oil paintings, drawings, etchings, and watercolors, as well as eleven novels. He was famous, too, for the countless controversies he happily provoked throughout his long life. As his granddaughter later explained: &#x201c;He fought the wowsers, he fought the hypocrites, the people that were going to stop and stifle creative freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of thought.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norman Lindsay&#x2019;s home is now a museum of his works run by Australia&#x2019;s National Trust. After entertaining generations of young Australians, <i>The Magic Pudding</i> is recognized as a classic of children&#x2019;s literature, and in 2000 a sculpture of Bunyip Bluegum and friends (including the Puddin&#x2019; itself) was unveiled as the centerpiece of the children&#x2019;s garden at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne.<br><br>Philip Pullman is the author of the trilogy <i>His Dark Materials</i>, the third book of which, <i>The Amber Spyglass</i>, was the first children&#x2019;s book to win the Whitbread Book of the Year Award in the UK.

"Wanting more is the nature of our soul, mind, heart, and senses," he says. As an antidote of sorts to the sometimes overly strict books of late that advocate a life of utter simplicity, he concedes that it's okay to want a big promotion or fancy car. It's also noble to want a solid spiritual life and to want to be at peace with yourself. However, he says, you need to recognize and work on the many self-defeating behaviors that may be thwarting your chances for reaching your goals. In fact, he identifies 24 typical stumbling blocks to look for. <p> <i>How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have</i> is perfect for the ostensibly successful businesspeople who can't explain why they're miserable, or people who blame their partners for their miseries instead of looking inward. It's filled with anecdotes and tools to help you achieve a fuller sense of identity. Gray says that one of the most important steps to reaching this level of self-awareness is meditation, and Gray gives dozens of stepping-off points for meditation exercises to help you ascertain what exactly it is that you want, and how to remove any obstacles--whether external or internal. Take it from a man who used to be so ascetic that he was rendered homeless but now has achieved a strong sense of self <i>and</i> has managed to write nine bestselling books: both spiritual and material success are within your grasp.</p><p>John Gray, Ph.D., is one of the world&#x2019;s leading relationship experts, and an authority on improving communication styles for couples, companies, and communities.
